OpenWERX Data Science - Grey Pill
Challenge Information

About this event

New communities are growing on the internet, but they are using decentralized architectures, peer-to-peer protocols, and cultural codes (emojis, meme gifs, etc) that make it harder to survey, map, and understand. Your challenge is to explore this new ecosystem and develop novel data science techniques to illuminate it.

You will be provided with a list of platform and protocol sources (Check the Rules for a comprehensive set of links to the data and other resources provided for this challenge.)

You must:

1. Scrape and ingest a representative set of content from each resource provided.

2. Perform text analysis (including entity extraction/identification, sentiment, etc) on all unstructured and structured text fields. This includes translating from the source language to English (at some point in the overall analytical pipeline)

3. Perform graph/SNA-type analysis on all relationship data (post, author, comment, etc)

4. Perform analysis on all media posted. Goal is to derive as much context as possible from a given media post as well as context of the collective post (media, non-media such as tags, comments, etc), and any other topical/contextual "channels".

5. Finally, you will have to provide an overall "contextual dashboard" to illustrate the topical/semantic/sentimental trends within and across different platforms and protocols. Extra credit for a "Grey Network Weather Report" that can illustrate probabilistic correlation over time series across all sources ingested.

This challenge is sponsored by Donovan Group, SOCOM J-5, and will be judged by Maj Jen Snow.

Rules

"Rules are for people without principles" - M. Scott

Here are the OpenWERX Principles:

Open Source We recommend that all your work for this Hackathon be made publicly available under an Open Source license. Make sure to submit your work to the repository of your choice, and include the URL in your video submission. If you use non-Open Source building blocks, frameworks, libraries, APIs, etc, you will face a points penalty during the judging phase.

Community We highly recommend you build a team with various skills. Remember that you will be judged by your approach and presentation, not just the work you actually accomplish.

Collaboration We use the #openwerx channel on the Suncoast Developer Guild's Slack. Go here to sign up: https://suncoast.io. This is where you can ask questions about the event and the challenges, and the judges will use Slack for team Q&A while they are reviewing your submissions.

Submissions You must make a 3-5 minute video demo your hack and upload it to YouTube. No slide-decks or Powerpoints will be allowed. During judging, at least one team member must monitor the #openwerx Slack channel to respond to any questions from the judges.

Suggested Data Sources:

1. ZeroMe (decentralized social media through the Zeronet network). You can either install the Zeronet (https://zeronet.io/) software, or use a public proxy.

2. SteemIt (social network with cryptocurrency rewards for content contributors): https://steemit.com

3. Mastadon (distributed social network): https://mastodon.social/about. We recommend scraping the Federated feed (https://mastodon.network/web/timelines/public)

4. IPFS (p2p hypermedia protocol): https://ipfs.io/. There are search utilities and websites that make this easier (http://ipfs-search.com/ and https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYo5ZWqNW4ib1Ck4zdm6EKteX3zZWw1j4CVfKtnAzNdvu/)

You can use any publicly available information set to help you with this challenge
