IRC 

- Watch for instances of the gif / file, use find or search
- Pull the file and get the Exif / Meta
- Get the info on the client that left the file
- Get the list of people in the irc channel, then get their info
- Wait to see if anyone responds to the file, weight that client id heavier than the others
