Those people appear to be much smarter than people who know only one language.\nAnother one reason: you can have your own ZeroNet site just by wanting to do so. You do not need to ask/pay someone else to let you have your own web site. Same with \"registration\" - you just create ID, you do not need someone else to allow you to have one via stupid \"registration\" process.",
