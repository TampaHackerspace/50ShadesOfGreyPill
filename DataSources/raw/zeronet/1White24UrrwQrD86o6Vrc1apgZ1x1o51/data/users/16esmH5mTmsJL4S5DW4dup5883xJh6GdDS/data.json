			"body": "@Evilpartisan: Our languages are multidimensional as well. A good example of this is to take a word, and then apply a tone to it. For instance saying sorry can be said in a sincere or sarcastic tone which would change the meaning.\n\nIn addition it is also linear like most of our languages, however one difference is it being cyclical since they experience all their tenses at the same time. This would make it weird for them to talk about things in a past/present/future tense like we do. Hence why we see them say for example \"Evilpartisan is in eating breakfast process\" (more or less).",

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",
