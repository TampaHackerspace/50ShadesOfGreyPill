I just did a quick test compressing ZeroTalk user files:\n> \n> Raw, separate files: 7.6MB\n> tar: 12MB (hm)\n> zip: 4.8MB\n> tar.gz: 3.1MB\n> tar.bz2: 2.4MB\n> tar.zstandard: 2.1MB\n> tar.brotli: 2.0MB\n> tar.xz: 1.9MB\n\nTry [lzip](http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/) too, its author is really anal about replacing xz with lzip, and has a few really good points in doing so. Also good compression and often a bit faster compared to xz.\n\n",

At least this is not a scam convincing you to lease your storage in exchange of valuable malware using you as a spam zombie.\n\nWhich reminds me: when will we get spammers abusing the net?",
