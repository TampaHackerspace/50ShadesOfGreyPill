If I want to make some sequential actions with API I must create a dozen of nested callbacks. I cant create wrapper with API call inside and reuse this code in several complex methods instead I create a chain of nested callbacks in every method.\nI.e. how can I make something like this: \nvar key = this.cmd(\"userPublickey\", [])\nOr this is impossible because ZeroFrame API is asynchronous by design?",
