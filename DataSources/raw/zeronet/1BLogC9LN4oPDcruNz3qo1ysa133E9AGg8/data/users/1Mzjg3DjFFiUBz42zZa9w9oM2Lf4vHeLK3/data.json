			"body": "--- Why decentralization important to you? --- (overlaps with the 2nd question)\n- Eliminating SPOF -s which are not just servers but people, technology, firms, etc... \n- decentralized technologies are mostly built on incentives, (and not on rules / punishments), which can be show a better way for us (hopefully)\n\n--- What's bad with the current internet? --- (overlaps with the prev. question)\n\"Great power comes with great responsibility\", but in centralized systems, responsibility is unproportionally smaller. Someone who has ~ x10000 power, with  ~ x2 responsibility makes him an irresistibly valuable target for anyone who want to benefit this power, which is .... well, very likely to happen. \n\n--- Why are you using ZeroNet? ---\nUsing ZeroNet requires some curiosity, openness, sometimes tolerance, some intelligence, low level of bias (which keeps people hooked with e.g. facebook), so people without those traits will leave, if they even try it. I'd like to avoid those people, which is done by ZeroNet \"bydesign\" :)\n\n--- Or just what do you think, what should I talk about? ---\nI think it's up to you to decide, you've put so much hard work to make it happen, and now you can talk about anything you like, enjoy, you'll be great! :)",
