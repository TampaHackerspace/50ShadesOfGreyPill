But keep in mind master branch is always unstable, so make a backup always first\n\nI did but no search field appears. Also the instructions do sound like they are for making sure a site appears in the list of search results. They do not sound like instructions for making a search field appear on the HelloZeroNet main page. I have 0.3.7 REV 1235 - which updates automatically for me when an update is pushed.",

Brilliant thank you. It would probably be better to automatically be visible and search all seeded sites at least.",
