The only problem is that people keep linking to 127.0.0.1:43110 when they link to a zeronet site which obviously doesn't work unless you do port forwarding. There are a couple of plugins for chrome that help but nothing that's perfect yet.\n\nDoesn't the JavaScript automagically convert the links for you? I almost never have this \"link-to-localhost problem\" -- while I do run ZeroNet node on an ARM board (a separate host on the LAN).",
