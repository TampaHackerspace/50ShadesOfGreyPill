The only problem is that people keep linking to 127.0.0.1:43110 when they link to a zeronet site which obviously doesn't work unless you do port forwarding. There are a couple of plugins for chrome that help but nothing that's perfect yet.\n\nThis is not an issuer for me: I open the IP range and use password.\n\nSo this is not the problem :-(",
