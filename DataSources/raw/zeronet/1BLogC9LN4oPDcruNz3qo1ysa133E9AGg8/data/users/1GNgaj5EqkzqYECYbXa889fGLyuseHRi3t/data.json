If the video can be publish by TED, which will let much more people know ZeroNet. \n\nNow the web 2.0 has many bad things like : if the website's server is down ,the site will come out 404 ,but zeronet don't need to care about this,because we have a lot of peers.\n\nMany countries like China, people need ZeroNet work.  :)\nI am Chinese ,I VERY love ZeroNet.\n\n In my opinion ,Don't introduce PLAY ! This will let people think zeronet is a pirate paradise. ! But it can prove that zeronet is a real freedom place .",
