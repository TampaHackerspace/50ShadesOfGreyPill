In the beginning it was a small (mainly academic) group of people who wanted to make something new just for fun. We have waited for minutes just to download a photo on a young woman. :-) During the years more and more people connected to the network. Big companies started to invest into their internet projects and the whole net started to focus on business more and more. I call this process something like 'commercification'.\nWith the start of facebook this process has fastened more.\n99% of the internet is waste.\nThis project can be a new start and new hope to allow the intenet to be the one it was to be by Sir Tim-Berners Lee.\nDecentralization can be the key to a free internet. No websites would be discriminated by governments nor ISPs.",
