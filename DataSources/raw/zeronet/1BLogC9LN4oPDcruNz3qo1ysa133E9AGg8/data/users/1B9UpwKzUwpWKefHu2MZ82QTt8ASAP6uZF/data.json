I am on windows, and I execute the bundle command. what I get in return is \"The system cannot find the path specified.\"\n\nSo, I tried something else. I went into my Python folder and just executed \"python.exe zeronet.py siteCreate\". I get another error saying that zeronet.py does not exist.\n\nI know that zeronet.py does exist, however, in my \"ZeroNet\" folder. I go into that folder and execute \"zeronet.py siteCreate\". All it does in this case it open zeronet.py, and nothing else.\n\nCan anyone help?",

I just wish there was an easier way to save private key on windows, and not to physically type each part in.",
