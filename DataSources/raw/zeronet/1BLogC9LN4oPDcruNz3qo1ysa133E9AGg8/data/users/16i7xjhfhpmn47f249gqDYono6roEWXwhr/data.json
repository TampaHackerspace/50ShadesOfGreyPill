Man, don't need to be nervous ,just relax to speech ,Come on .We goal is  to build the Web 3.0ï¼ŒMany people in the world need more free speech. If the video can be publish by TED, which will let much more people know ZeroNet. \n> Now the web 2.0 has many bad things like : if the website's server is down ,the site will come out 404 ,but zeronet don't need to care about this,because we have a lot of peers.\n> Many countries like China, people need ZeroNet work.  :)I am Chinese ,I VERY love ZeroNet.\n>  In my opinion ,Don't introduce PLAY ! This will let people think zeronet is a pirate paradise. ! But it can prove that zeronet is a real freedom place .\n\nI fully agree, just \"Web2.0\" is a marketing gimmick:\nCurrently still everything is based on pretty much the same Internet 1.0 bases, just big corporations subverted and turned it upside down.\nMaybe Ajax and co. have led to Internet 1.1 or 1.5, but we're still waiting for a true Internet/Web 2.0, which is using technologies from 1.5 to form the decentralized web of the future. \nTldr: \"Web2.0\" is a corporate marketing term to delusion the masses into believing in progress of the web, where there is none but on the surface.",
