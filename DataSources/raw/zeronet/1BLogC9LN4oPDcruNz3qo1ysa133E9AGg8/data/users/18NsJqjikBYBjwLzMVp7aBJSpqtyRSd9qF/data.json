If a show of some kind (TV, webshow, etc) has several big sponsors and one removes themself from the show, the show looses a huge amount of money. A more decentralized version is a system where viewers donate instead--there's less of a chance that lots of them will stop donating all at once. Spreading power among the users turns a monarchy-like system into a more democratic one.\n\nThere are probably other metaphors like this that might be useful, I'll put any others I think of here.",
