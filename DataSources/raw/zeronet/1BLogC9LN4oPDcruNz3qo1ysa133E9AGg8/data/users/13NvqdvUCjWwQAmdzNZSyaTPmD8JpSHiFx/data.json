			"body": "Decentralization is the future of the internet - mark my words.\nWith long-range WiFi (900Mhz can go around 1 kilometer) and a local server you can host your own internet! Someone can connect, upload what they have, download what you have, update what you both share. Maybe you have a good \"commercial\" connection and can download and host a ton of content, that's good. Or you have terrible \"commercial\" and rely on that one person hosting a content node down the block. Or there IS no other connection and an updated drive is passed around (like down in Cuba) to be copied locally.\n\nThe current internet is controlled by a few big content providers. For now, they're fairly benign, but they're companies - they'll do what is best for them. You can't rely on goodwill preventing censorship.\n\nI use ZeroNet because I have spare bandwidth and a spare computer to run it on - I am a content node. I visit a few new places each day (usually) and there you go, new host.\n\nTalk about ZeroNet. Be excited about it. It's a baby, when it grows up who knows what it'll be.\n\nAnd remember to picture everyone naked. ",
