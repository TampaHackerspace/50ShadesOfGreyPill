			"body": "> **Update Apr 03, 2017:** I got a unanticipated reach from the TED organizers and unfortunately they cancelled my talk, because they think it’s not the right time for it yet... see you in another future.\n\nIn last December I got an totally unexpected email, that had an invitation to give a 18 minute talk in front of 2000 people in a very big and a famous event in Vancouver, Canada, on the [next TED conference](https://ted2017.ted.com/).\n\n![1489106790.jpg (1200x492)](data/img/post_107_1489106790.jpg)\n\nAt that very moment I knew: [I'm not ready for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frwwE9PCILU).\n\nI get really nervous speaking in front of more than 3 people, my English is not that good and I had no idea what and how to tell anything to the audience.\n\n### So I had two options: run and turn it down or push myself out of my comfort planet and fight.\n\nThen I realized that probably this going to be one of my biggest opportunities of my entire life, so even if I never wanted an attention like this, I have to accept this honorific reach.\n\nAfter I did some verification on the email header to see if it's not just a bad joke, I have accepted the invitation and immediately started to search for help.\n\nSome weeks later I joined a [rhetorical group](http://toastmasters.hu/) and in small steps I started to prepare my talk. Over the last 3 months I spent many-many hours on writing, memorizing, practicing and presenting lots of talks. (I just finished the [last one 4 hours ago](https://www.facebook.com/events/1100507716762021/)) Based on the feedback I did improved a lot, but I still have lot to do.\n\n### Why do I think this is so important for me and for the project?\n\nTED is like the world championship or Olympics of ideas.\nI think it's safe to say you can't find a conference where you words have more weight, than the ones you say in the stage of the TED.\nThe average video impressions on [ted.com](http://www.ted.com/) is over 1 million.\nThis also means a lots of press coverage, probably invitation to other conferences and helps with the general acceptance of the project.\nJust some people who did a presentation on TED: [Edward Snowden](http://www.ted.com/talks/edward_snowden_here_s_how_we_take_back_the_internet), [Linus Torvalds](http://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux), [Elon Musk](http://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity), [Bill Gates](http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates), [Larry Page and Sergey Brin](http://www.ted.com/talks/sergey_brin_and_larry_page_on_google), [Stephen Hawking](http://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_hawking_asks_big_questions_about_the_universe) and many other genius people.\n\n**I need your help:** Please share your thoughts/ideas/stories about:\n\n*   Why decentralization important to you?\n\n*   What's bad with the current internet?\n\n*   Why are you using ZeroNet?\n\n*   Or just what do you think, what should I talk about?\n\nThanks: Tamas"

Here is my benchmarks on page load times with 300 svg icons:\n\n| File type | Size | Intel i5 | Chip ARMv7 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Raw](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1AsRLpuRxr3pb9p3TKoMXPSWHzh6i7fMGi/icons/icons.html) | 1.1MB | 910ms | 2.72s |\n| [Zip](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1AsRLpuRxr3pb9p3TKoMXPSWHzh6i7fMGi/icons.zip/icons.html) | 452kB | 918ms | 3.47s |\n| [Tar.gz](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1AsRLpuRxr3pb9p3TKoMXPSWHzh6i7fMGi/icons.tar.gz/icons.html) | 241kB | 1.8s | 10.46s |\n\nThe .zip compression has very small overhead so it's recommended to use that one if you planning to include many resources in one page.\n\nUtf-8 file names also supported in archives. (I recommend using [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) in that case)\n\nExample: [árvíztűrőTükörógép中华.txt](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1AsRLpuRxr3pb9p3TKoMXPSWHzh6i7fMGi/icons.zip/árvíztűrőTükörógép中华.txt)\n\nOther changes:\n\n*   Much faster update times due the re-written socket sharing algorithm\n*   Lots of enhancements for slower/Tor connections (thx @P2P for suggestions)\n*   Added version infos to [/Benchmark](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Benchmark)\n*   Experimental `--db_mode secure` database mode to prevent data loss on systems with unreliable power source.\n*   In Tor mode support tor controllers running other than 127.0.0.1\n*   Benchmark only do 1000 loops of os.random, since it's not that important\n*   Fix missing json_row errors when using Mute plugin\n\nMultiUser mode enhancements:\n\n*   Signing in using any master_seed from **data/users.json** will act as master user without any proxy restriction, so they can update/shutdown ZeroNet, add/remove Muted users, change limit, etc.\n*   `--multiuser_no_new_sites` mode: normal users will not able to add new sites, only use the current ones.\n\n* * *\n\nZeroBlog\n\n*   Auto follow new posts on first visit, auto follow mentions on username change\n\nZeroTalk\n\n*   Auto follow new topics on first visit, auto follow mentions on username change, auto follow topics you commented on\n\nZeroMe\n\n*   Auto follow mentions and comments on my posts on username change"

First I turned down the invitation, because I spent my 32 years to desperately try to avoid speaking in front of lots of people, but fortunately one week later they reached me again: _I have to be there at all cost._\n\n![1484303724.jpg (1200x399)](data/img/post_102_1484303724.jpg)\n\nSo gave in, flew there, did my talk, I think it was horrible, I was very nervous, but after my presentation I got lots of positive feedback, met really nice and friendly people and it was very uplifting to hear that the original inventors of the Internet - [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) and [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) - are at least concerned about Internet centralization as I do, so I came back with very positive feelings.\n\nThen did an another speak in [Berlin](http://get-d.net/) and around that time a company reached me that they really like my project and want to sponsorship me, so in September I was able to left my job (after 8 years) and start focusing on ZeroNet.\n\nIn December I got an unexpected reach that is offered a **HUGE** opportunity for me and for the project. It's going to be a big challenge for me and requires lots of effort, but I accepted it and immediately started working on it. I can't tell any more details, but I guarantee you won't be disappointed if it turns out well.\n\nThanks for the year-long support and stay tuned! :)"

			"body": "In this tutorial we going to build a P2P, decentralized, server and backend-less chat site in less then 100 lines of code.\n_(This is a simplified and pure-javascript rework of the original tutorial.)_\n\n[![](data/img/zerochat.png)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Ao2w61hpihHgCb44Tjbv7dCE3ifbaiscK)\n\n* * *\n\n### Creating new site\n\n*   Click on ⋮ > “**Create new, empty site**” menu item on the site ZeroHello.\n*   You will be **redirected** to a completely new site that is only modifiable by you!\n*   **Drag the top-right “0” button** to left to show the sidebar\n*   At the bottom change the **Site title** to “My ZeroChat tutorial”, then press “**Save site settings**”.\n\n### The chat site’s HTML code\n\n*   **Open** “data/[yoursiteaddress]/index.html” file in you favorite editor.\n*   **Change** the `<body>` tag’s content to:\n\n```html\n<body>\n\n<a href=\"#Select+user\" id=\"select_user\" onclick='return page.selectUser()'>Select user</a>:\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"message\">\n<input type=\"button\" id=\"send\" value=\"Send!\" onclick=\"return page.sendMessage()\"/>\n<ul id=\"messages\">\n <li>Welcome to ZeroChat!</li>\n</ul>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/ZeroFrame.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n```\n\nThe **js/ZeroFrame.js** file (automatically bundled if you create your site using ZeroHello) contains the ZeroFrame class that allows us to communicate with the websocket based [ZeroFrame API](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/).\n\n### First ZeroFrame API call\n\n*   Initialize our application in a `<script>` block, after the ZeroFrame.js include:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/ZeroFrame.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\nclass ZeroChat extends ZeroFrame {\n    addMessage (username, message) {\n        var message_escaped = message.replace(/</g, \"&lt;\").replace(/>/g, \"&gt;\")  // Escape html tags in the message\n        this.messages.innerHTML += \"<li><b>\" + username + \"</b>: \" + message_escaped + \"</li>\"\n    }\n\n    onOpenWebsocket () {\n        this.messages = document.getElementById(\"messages\")\n        this.addMessage(\"System\", \"Ready to call ZeroFrame API!\")\n    }\n}\n\npage = new ZeroChat()\n</script>\n```\n\n*   If we **reload** the page we should see a “Ready to call ZeroFrame API!” message.\n*   To make the “Select User” button display the user select dialog **add** the following function to the ZeroChat class:\n\n```javascript\n    selectUser () {\n        this.cmd(\"certSelect\", {accepted_domains: [\"zeroid.bit\"]})\n        return false\n    }\n```\n\n### Display user’s current ZeroID account\n\nWhen something changed that is affects the site (new content arrived, user changed, etc.) a websocket event will be **pushed** to your browser.\n(the format is same as you query [siteInfo](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzeronet.readthedocs.org%2Fen%2Flatest%2Fsite_development%2Fzeroframe_api_reference%2F%23siteinfo) command)\n\n*   To **handle** this event add this to our class:\n\n```javascript\n    onRequest (cmd, message) {\n        if (cmd == \"setSiteInfo\") {\n            if (message.params.cert_user_id)\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = message.params.cert_user_id\n            else\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = \"Select user\"\n            this.site_info = message.params  // Save site info data to allow access it later\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis code will real-time update the currently selected user name.\n\n*   To also display the currently selected username when the page loads **add** this to “**onOpenWebsocket**” function:\n\n```javascript\n        this.cmd(\"siteInfo\", {}, (site_info) => {\n            if (site_info.cert_user_id)\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerText = site_info.cert_user_id\n            this.site_info = site_info\n        })\n```\n\nNow our application should always display the currently selected user correctly. _(Even if its modified from other browser window)_\n\n### Setting user content permissions\n\nTo allow other users to post on our site we have to define the rules of the third-party content.\n\nCreate a **data/users/content.json** file in your site’s directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {},\n  \"ignore\": \".*\",\n  \"modified\": 0.0,\n  \"signs\": {},\n  \"user_contents\": {\n    \"cert_signers\": {\n      \"zeroid.bit\": [ \"1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz\" ]\n    },\n    \"permission_rules\": {\n      \".*\": {\n        \"files_allowed\": \"data.json\",\n        \"max_size\": 10000\n      },\n      \"bitmsg/.*@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 15000 }\n    },\n    \"permissions\": {\n      \"bad@zeroid.bit\": false,\n      \"nofish@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 100000 }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*   `\"ignore\": \".*\"`: The files in this directory will be signed by the users and not by the site’s owner.\n*   `cert_signers`: We accept *@zeroid.bit users and they have to come with a cert that is has to signed by 1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz address.\n*   `permission_rules`: We give 10kbytes of space to every user (15kb if registered using bitmessage)\n*   `permissions`: Per-user permissions: ban “bad@zeroid.bit” user and allow 100k storage to “nofish@zeroid.bit” user. ( it's me :) )\n\nAfter we saved this file we also have to modify our site’s **root content.json** to ignore everything in this directory on signing and load the file containing the rules:\n\n```json\n  ...\n    \"ignore\": \"data/.*\",\n    \"includes\": {\n        \"data/users/content.json\": {\n            \"signers\": [],\n            \"signers_required\": 1\n        }\n    },\n  ...\n```\n\n> **Note**: You can give moderation permissions to other users by adding addresses to “signers” list.\n\n*   **Sign** the **root content.json** modifications by pressing the “Sign” button on the sidebar.\n*   Then keep the sidebar open and change “content.json” to “**data/users/content.json**” and press the “**Sign**” button again!\n\n### Adding messages to our json file\n\nWhen hitting the **Send** button we going to add the message to our user’s **data.json** file, sign it, then publish it to other users.\n\n*   Create a new function in ZeroChat class:\n\n```javascript\n    sendMessage () {\n        if (!this.site_info.cert_user_id) {  // No account selected, display error\n            this.cmd(\"wrapperNotification\", [\"info\", \"Please, select your account.\"])\n            return false\n        }\n\n        // This is our data file path\n        var data_inner_path = \"data/users/\" + this.site_info.auth_address + \"/data.json\"\n        var content_inner_path = \"data/users/\" + this.site_info.auth_address + \"/content.json\"\n\n        // Load our current messages\n        this.cmd(\"fileGet\", {\"inner_path\": data_inner_path, \"required\": false}, (data) => {\n            if (data)  // Parse current data file\n                data = JSON.parse(data)\n            else  // Not exists yet, use default data\n                data = { \"message\": [] }\n\n            // Add the new message to data\n            data.message.push({\n                \"body\": document.getElementById(\"message\").value,\n                \"date_added\": Date.now()\n            })\n\n            // Encode data array to utf8 json text\n            var json_raw = unescape(encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data, undefined, '\\t')))\n\n            // Write file to disk\n            this.cmd(\"fileWrite\", [data_inner_path, btoa(json_raw)], (res) => {\n                if (res == \"ok\") {\n                    // Reset the message input\n                    document.getElementById(\"message\").value = \"\"\n                    // Sign the changed file in our user's directory\n                    this.cmd(\"siteSign\", {\"inner_path\": content_inner_path}, (res) => {\n                        // Publish to other users\n                        this.cmd(\"sitePublish\", {\"inner_path\": content_inner_path, \"sign\": false})\n                    })\n                } else {\n                    this.cmd(\"wrapperNotification\", [\"error\", \"File write error: #{res}\"])\n                }\n            })\n        })\n\n        return false\n    }\n```\n\n*   After this modification **type something** to the message input and press the **Send** button! You should see the message in the data/users/[your auth address]/data.json file.\n\n    _(Don’t worry if you see “Publish failed” message: it is normal, since we don’t have any other users on our site yet)_\n\n### Creating database\n\nNow we can save and publish our messages to other users, let’s display it in our application! The best way to do this is map all data.json files to an SQL database.\n\nThe ZeroNet automatically do this for you, all you need is a **dbschema.json** file in your site’s directory that describe your table structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"db_name\": \"ZeroChat\",\n    \"db_file\": \"data/zerochat.db\",\n    \"version\": 2,\n    \"maps\": {\n        \"users/.+/data.json\": {\n            \"to_table\": [ \"message\" ]\n        },\n        \"users/.+/content.json\": {\n            \"to_json_table\": [ \"cert_user_id\" ],\n            \"file_name\": \"data.json\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"tables\": {\n        \"json\": {\n            \"cols\": [\n                [\"json_id\", \"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT\"],\n                [\"directory\", \"TEXT\"],\n                [\"file_name\", \"TEXT\"],\n                [\"cert_user_id\", \"TEXT\"]\n            ],\n            \"indexes\": [\"CREATE UNIQUE INDEX path ON json(directory, file_name)\"],\n            \"schema_changed\": 10\n        },\n        \"message\": {\n            \"cols\": [\n                [\"body\", \"TEXT\"],\n                [\"date_added\", \"INTEGER\"],\n                [\"json_id\", \"INTEGER REFERENCES json (json_id)\"]\n            ],\n            \"indexes\": [\"CREATE UNIQUE INDEX message_key ON message(json_id, date_added)\"],\n            \"schema_changed\": 10\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*   `\"db_name\": \"ZeroChat\"`: Used only for debugging\n*   `\"db_file\": \"data/zerochat.db\"`: The SQLite database file will be stored here\n*   `\"version\": 2`: Define the json table structure, version 2 is better suited to ZeroID based sites. More info in the [reference docs](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzeronet.readthedocs.org%2Fen%2Flatest%2Fsite_development%2Fdbschema_json%2F).\n*   `\"maps\": {`: Describes the json files -> table conversion\n*   `\"users/.+/data.json\": { \"to_table\": [ \"message\" ] }`: Put the data from every **user's data.json** file **message node** to **message table**.\n*   `\"users/.+/content.json\": { \"to_json_table\": [ \"cert_user_id\" ], \"file_name\": \"data.json\"}`: For easy SQL Join store the **username** in the data.json file's **json table** entry.\n*   `\"tables\": {`: Describe the tables and indexing structure. A json table entry will be created automatically for every **json** file.\n*   `[\"json_id\", \"INTEGER REFERENCES json (json_id)\"]`: Every table should contain a **json_id** column, it defines the source file path.\n*   `\"schema_changed\": 10`: **Increment** this when you change the table structure, so the peers can **drop the table and re-create** it from the json files.\n\n> **Tip**: For the best performance always create an index for json_id column in your tables, because when new file arrives the data will be updated based on this column.\n\n*   Press the **Reload**, then the **Rebuild** button on the sidebar to generate the database.\n\nIf you did everything well, then the **data/zerochat.db** SQLite file will be created. To browse these files I recommend using [SQLiteStudio](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsqlitestudio.pl%2F) (it’s free and opensource)\n\n### Displaying messages\n\nThe messages are loaded to the SQL database, so we can easily query them using the **dbQuery command**:\n\n```javascript\n    loadMessages () {\n        this.cmd(\"dbQuery\", [\"SELECT * FROM message LEFT JOIN json USING (json_id) ORDER BY date_added DESC\"], (messages) => {\n            document.getElementById(\"messages\").innerHTML = \"\"  // Always start with empty messages\n            for (var i=0; i < messages.length; i++) {\n                this.addMessage(messages[i].cert_user_id, messages[i].body)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n```\n\nAdd `this.loadMessages()` to **onOpenWebsocket** function, then reload the page and you should see the messages you typed in.\n\nTo make it “real time” and display new messages immediately as they come in you also have to add the `this.loadMessages()` to the **onRequest** function:\n\n```javascript\n    onRequest (cmd, message) {\n        if (cmd == \"setSiteInfo\") {\n            if (message.params.cert_user_id)\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = message.params.cert_user_id\n            else\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = \"Select user\"\n            this.site_info = message.params  // Save site info data to allow access it later\n\n            // Reload messages if new file arrives\n            if (message.params.event[0] == \"file_done\")\n                this.loadMessages()\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nAlso reload the data when we **submit** a new message:\n\n```javascript\n    sendMessage () {\n        ...\n                    // Sign the changed file in our user's directory\n                    this.cmd(\"siteSign\", {\"inner_path\": content_inner_path}, (res) => {\n                        this.loadMessages() // Reload messages\n                        ...\n        ...\n```\n\n**That’s it!** Now the messages are updated in real-time! You can try it by opening an another browser window and enter a messages there.\n\n### Final touches\n\n*   Send messages by pressing enter\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"message\" onkeypress=\"if (event.keyCode == 13) page.sendMessage()\">\n```\n\n*   And add some CSS style to make it look better\n\n```html\n<style>\n* { font-family: monospace; line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: middle; }\nbody { background-color: white; }\ninput#message { padding: 5px; width: 50%;  }\ninput#send { height: 34px; margin-left: -2px; }\nul { padding: 0px; }\nli { list-style-type: none; border-top: 1px solid #eee; padding: 5px 0px; }\nli:nth-child(odd) { background-color: #F9FAFD; }\nli b { color: #3F51B5; }\n</style>\n```\n\n### Congratulations! You have completed the ZeroChat tutorial! :)\n\nSome idea for improvements:\n\n*   Display message time\n*   Move source code to separate .js file\n*   Limit displayed messages / add paging\n*   Markdown formatting\n*   Username mention\n\n> **Tip:** The .js files are cached. To avoid it you need to keep open the Dev Console (F12) with \"Disable cache\" checked.\n> \n> **Tip:** Don't forget to re-sign and publish your site if you do any modification on the source code.\n> \n> **Tip:** Your site's private key is in data/users.json file (search for your site's address, then there will be a privatekey entry), so it's a good idea to backup it!\n> \n> **Tip:** ZeroNet has a built-in .js and .css merging feature for developers. To enable it add `debug` to `zeronet.conf` file's `[global]` section, then it will response every file's content in the directory if you request all.js or all.css"

			"body": "The currently under development, merger sites feature will allow you to separate the data and the display logic into multiple sites. \n\nThis will result in multiple benefits:\n\n---\n## Scalability\nEvery user/language/category/etc. can be put to separate site, so you can create large sites without any problem, because the visitors will only seed the content they are interested in. To showcase this, there will be a twitter or facebook-like social site, where you only seed and receive updates for the users (or user groups) you are interested in.\n\n## Decentralization\nThe merger sites will also have positive effect on decentralization: The data and the display logic will be separated so you can easily create your own version of the display logic site and you (and any user who will use your changed display logic site) will be still able to access the same data (eg. profiles) as the original one. (For example: Dark design, New interaction forms, Different list ordering, New features, etc.)\n\n## Security\nIf you want to avoid to run untrusted javascript code you can pause the display logic site, review the source and you will still receive and see the new content on profiles you following. Using the clone feature and a version management software (eg. git) you can review the later changes before accepting it to your own version of the site.\n\n## When?\nIt’s progressing well, there was some technical challenges, but I think the core modification done now. Currently [building the social site](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/232). I will try to publish it before my vacation (next week going to Italy for some weeks), but I try to make it as bug-free as possible, so maybe it will be done after my vacation."

Since the first version, to extend the possibilities of the network lots of new feature added:\n\n---\n\n## Multi-user sites \nIt allows the site owner to define per-file permissions, so the users able to post new comments, upvotes, etc. without contacting the site owner. The site owner also has ability to limit user’s files total size or type of uploaded files.\n\n## SQL database \nThe built-in SQLite database engine makes sites load faster and also greatly simplifies the development process. The records synchronized the same, P2P way as any other file.\n\n![Domain](data/img/domain.png)\n\n## OpenProxy support \nBrowse and interact ZeroNet sites without downloading anything.\n\n## Namecoin domains \nEasier to remember site addresses using .bit domain names instead of 35 character long addresses. There is also a Chrome plugin that allows your to access ZeroNet sites like any other site on the internet, eg. by typing http://blog.zeronetwork.bit in address bar.\n\n## Optional files \nAllows the site owner to define files that is only downloaded when the user’s browser requests it. It makes possible to create larger sites (eg. photo galleries) without overload the visitors disk. \n_Large file (>1MB) hosting support is planned later._\n\n<a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Gif7PqWTzVWDQ42Mo7np3zXmGAo3DXc7h\"><img src=\"data/img/optional.png\"/></a>\n\n## Encrypted connections \nTo make the network more resilient to surveillance by encrypting the connection between peers using TLS.\n\n## AES & ECIES API functions \nMakes possible to create end-to-end encrypted data and messages.\n\n![Domain](data/img/zeromail.png)\n\n## Anonymity with full Tor support \nGreatly increase privacy by communicate and host sites using .onion instead of IPv4 addresses.\n\n## Newsfeed \nFollow your favorite sites in a simple, clean and customizable newsfeed. You can choose what you want to see: new topics/comments/new blog posts.\n\n_And many other feature and speedup to make ZeroNet faster and easier to use…_\n\n## What’s next? \nWe still committed to make the internet more decentralized and have tons of ideas. Will try to focus on content by creating new sites: Infinetly scalable social site, Github-like project hosting, Marketplace, Image hosting, …\n\nAnd core enhancements also planned: I2P and IPv6 network, Big file support, Intelligent optional files cache limit, Content deduplication, Private sites, …\n\n**Stay tuned for 2016 :)**\n_We believe in\nopen, free, and uncensored\nnetwork and communication._"

If port open fails it sets up tor hidden services, so other peers able to reach you directly, this improve the network quality especially on new sites.\n - Always: Completely hides your IP and use Tor for every connection.\n\nOn Windows you don't have to do anything it will download the Tor client on first startup. On other OS you can find simple instructions in `tools/tor/manual_install.txt` file. \n\nI planning to add some configuration options to the GUI eg. to make it simpler to switch between Tor modes."

			"body": "In [part1](./?Post:43:ZeroNet+site+development+tutorial+1) we created a ZeroNet site with some simple ZeroFrame API call.\n\nWe going to extend it to accept, store and query messages using a SQLite database and use ZeroID to identify user names.\n\nThe final page and source code is available at http://127.0.0.1:43110/1AvF5TpcaamRNtqvN1cnDEWzNmUtD47Npg\n\n---\n\n\n## Adding ZeroID user selector\n\nAdd a new link to **index.html** that will allow us to select the ZeroID identity we want to use:\n\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n<a href=\"#Select+user\" id=\"select_user\" onclick='return Page.selectUser()'>Select user</a>:\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"message\"><input type=\"button\" id=\"send\" value=\"Send!\"/>\n<ul id=\"messages\">\n <li>Welcome to ZeroChat!</li>\n</ul>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/all.js\" async></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nTo make it work add a function to **js/ZeroChat.coffee** that displays the certificate selection dialog to user:\n\n```coffeescript\n    selectUser: =>\n        Page.cmd \"certSelect\", [[\"zeroid.bit\"]]\n        return false\n```\n\nAs parameter you should include the accepted certificate provider names. (zeroid.bit here)\n\nIf you hit a refresh and click on \"Select user\", then you should see the dialog, but nothing changes when you select your zeroid certificate.\n\n\n## Display user's current ZeroID account\n\nWhen something is changed that affects the site (new content arrived, user changed, etc.) a websocket event will be pushed to your browser.\n_(the format is same as you query [setSiteInfo](http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/#siteinfo) command)_\n\nTo handle this event add this function:\n\n```coffeescript\n    route: (cmd, message) ->\n        if cmd == \"setSiteInfo\"\n            if message.params.cert_user_id\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = message.params.cert_user_id\n            else\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = \"Select user\"\n            @site_info = message.params  # Save site info data to allow access it later\n```\n\nThis code will real-time update the user's currently selected user name.\n\nTo also update the user name on page load modify the **onOpenWebsocket** function:\n\n```coffeescript\n    onOpenWebsocket: (e) =>\n        @cmd \"serverInfo\", {}, (server_info) =>\n            @addLine \"serverInfo response: <pre>\" + JSON.stringify(server_info,null,2) + \"</pre>\"\n        @cmd \"siteInfo\", {}, (site_info) =>\n            @addLine \"siteInfo response: <pre>\" + JSON.stringify(site_info,null,2) + \"</pre>\"\n            # Update currently selected username\n            if site_info.cert_user_id\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = site_info.cert_user_id\n            @site_info = site_info  # Save site info data to allow access it later\n```\n\n\n## Setting user content permissions\n\nTo allow users to post on our site we have to define the rules of the third-party content.\n\nCreate a **data/users** directory and create a **data/users/content.json** file in it:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {},\n  \"ignore\": \".*\",\n  \"modified\": 0.0,\n  \"signs\": {},\n  \"user_contents\": {\n    \"cert_signers\": {\n      \"zeroid.bit\": [ \"1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz\" ]\n    },\n    \"permission_rules\": {\n      \".*\": {\n        \"files_allowed\": \"data.json\",\n        \"max_size\": 10000\n      },\n      \"bitmsg/.*@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 15000 }\n    },\n    \"permissions\": {\n      \"bad@zeroid.bit\": false,\n      \"nofish@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 100000 }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- `\"ignore\": \".*\", `: When the site owner signing this content.json don't add any file to it, they will be signed by the users.\n- `cert_signers`: We accept *@zeroid.bit users and they have to come with a cert that is has to signed by `1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz` address.\n- `permission_rules`: We give 10kbytes of space to every user (15kb if registered using bitmessage)\n- `permissions`: Per-user permissions: ban bad@zeroid.bit user and allow 100k storage to nofish@zeroid.bit user. ( it's me :) )\n\nAfter we saved this file we have to modify our **root content.json** to also ignore files in this directory and load the file containing the rules:\n\n```json\n  ...\n  \"ignore\": \"data/.*\",\n  \"includes\": {\n    \"data/users/content.json\": {\n      \"signers\": [],\n      \"signers_required\": 1\n    }\n  },\n  ...\n```\n\n> **Note:** You can give moderation permissions to other users by adding addresses to \"signers\" list.\n\nNow we have to sign the **data/users/content.json** file using the following command:\n`zeronet.py siteSign [siteaddress] --inner_path data/users/content.json`\n\n\n## Adding messages to our json file\n\nWhen hitting the **Send** button we going to add the message to our **data.json** file, sign it, then publish it to other users.\n\n- First add the `onclick=\"return Page.sendMessage()\"` event listener to Send input button html tag.\n\n- Then create a new function in **ZeroChat.coffee**:\n\n```coffeescript\n    sendMessage: =>\n        if not Page.site_info.cert_user_id  # No account selected, display error\n            Page.cmd \"wrapperNotification\", [\"info\", \"Please, select your account.\"]\n            return false\n\n        inner_path = \"data/users/#{@site_info.auth_address}/data.json\"  # This is our data file\n\n        # Load our current messages\n        @cmd \"fileGet\", {\"inner_path\": inner_path, \"required\": false}, (data) =>\n            if data  # Parse if already exits\n                data = JSON.parse(data)\n            else  # Not exits yet, use default data\n                data = { \"message\": [] }\n\n            # Add the message to data\n            data.message.push({\n                \"body\": document.getElementById(\"message\").value,\n                \"date_added\": (+new Date)\n            })\n\n            # Encode data array to utf8 json text\n            json_raw = unescape(encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data, undefined, '\\t')))\n\n            # Write file to disk\n            @cmd \"fileWrite\", [inner_path, btoa(json_raw)], (res) =>\n                if res == \"ok\"\n                    # Publish the file to other users\n                    @cmd \"sitePublish\", {\"inner_path\": inner_path}, (res) =>\n                        document.getElementById(\"message\").value = \"\"  # Reset the message input\n                else\n                    @cmd \"wrapperNotification\", [\"error\", \"File write error: #{res}\"]\n\n        return false\n```\n\n- After this is done type something to the message input and press the **Send!** button! You should see the message in the **data/users/[your auth address]/data.json** file.\n\n\n## Creating database\n\nNow we can save and publish our messages to other users, let's display it in our application! The best way to do this is map all **data.json** files to an SQL database.\n\nThe ZeroNet automatically do this for you, all you need is a **dbschema.json** file in your site's directory that describe your table structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"db_name\": \"ZeroChat\",\n    \"db_file\": \"data/zerochat.db\",\n    \"version\": 2,\n    \"maps\": {\n        \"users/.+/data.json\": {\n            \"to_table\": [ \"message\" ]\n        },\n        \"users/.+/content.json\": {\n            \"to_keyvalue\": [ \"cert_user_id\" ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"tables\": {\n        \"message\": {\n            \"cols\": [\n                [\"body\", \"TEXT\"],\n                [\"date_added\", \"INTEGER\"],\n                [\"json_id\", \"INTEGER REFERENCES json (json_id)\"]\n            ],\n            \"indexes\": [\"CREATE UNIQUE INDEX message_key ON message(json_id, date_added)\"],\n            \"schema_changed\": 1\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n- `\"db_name\": \"ZeroChat\"`: Used only for debugging\n- `\"db_file\": \"data/zerochat.db\"`: The SQLite database file will be stored here\n- `\"version\": 2`: Define the json table structure, version 2 is better suited to ZeroID based sites. More info in the [reference docs](http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site_development/dbschema_json/).\n- `\"maps\": {`: Describe the json files -> table conversion\n- `\"users/.+/data.json\": { \"to_table\": [ \"message\" ] }`: Put the data from every user **data.json** file **message node** to **message table**.\n- `\"users/.+/content.json\": { \"to_keyvalue\": [ \"cert_user_id\" ] }`: Store the user's authentication id in simple key/value structure.\n- `\"tables\": {`: Describe the table and indexing structure.\n- `[\"json_id\", \"INTEGER REFERENCES json (json_id)\"]`: Every table should contain a **json_id** column, it defines the source file path.\n- `\"schema_changed\": 1`: Increment this when you change the **table structure**, so the peers can drop the table and **re-create** it from the json files.\n\n> **Tip:** For the best performance always create an **index** for **json_id** column in your tables, because when new file arrives the data will be updated based on this column.\n\nExecute `zeronet.py dbRebuild [your site address]` command to generate database from current files.\n\nThe **data/zerochat.db** SQLite file will be created, to browse these files I recommend using [SQLiteStudio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/) (it's free and opensource)\n\nAt this point you have to **restart** your ZeroNet client to detect and manage your site's newly created database.\n\n\n## Displaying messages\n\nAs the messages are now it the SQL database we can query them using the dbQuery command:\n\n```coffeescript\n    loadMessages: ->\n        @cmd \"dbQuery\", [\"SELECT * FROM message ORDER BY date_added\"], (messages) =>\n            document.getElementById(\"messages\").innerHTML = \"\"  # Always start with empty messages\n            for message in messages\n                @addLine message.body\n```\n\nAdd the `@loadMessages()` line to **onOpenWebsocket** function, then reload the page and you should see the messages you typed in.\n\nTo make it \"real time\" and display new messages immediately as they come in you have to add the `@loadMessages()` to the **route** part:\n\n```coffeescript\n    route: (cmd, message) ->\n        if cmd == \"setSiteInfo\"\n            if message.params.cert_user_id\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = message.params.cert_user_id\n            else\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = \"Select user\"\n            @site_info = message.params  # Save site info data to allow access it later\n\n            # Reload messages if new file arrives\n            if message.params.event[0] == \"file_done\"\n                @loadMessages()\n```\n\nAnd also reload the data when we submit a new message:\n\n```coffeescript\n    sendMessage: =>\n        ...\n            # Write file to disk\n            @cmd \"fileWrite\", [inner_path, btoa(json_raw)], (res) =>\n                @loadMessages()\n                ...\n        ...\n```\n\nThat's it! Now the messages are updated in real-time! You can try it by opening an another browser window and enter a messages there.\n\n\n## Displaying ZeroID usernames\n\nTo display the sender user name we have to create a more complex SQL query, because the user names are stored in `content.json` file and the messages are in `data.json`.\n\n\\+ we will also escape the incoming messages to disallow html codes.\n\n```coffeescript\n    loadMessages: ->\n        query = \"\"\"\n            SELECT message.*, keyvalue.value AS cert_user_id FROM message\n            LEFT JOIN json AS data_json USING (json_id)\n            LEFT JOIN json AS content_json ON (\n                data_json.directory = content_json.directory AND content_json.file_name = 'content.json'\n            )\n            LEFT JOIN keyvalue ON (keyvalue.key = 'cert_user_id' AND keyvalue.json_id = content_json.json_id)\n            ORDER BY date_added\n        \"\"\"\n        @cmd \"dbQuery\", [query], (messages) =>\n            document.getElementById(\"messages\").innerHTML = \"\"  # Always start with empty messages\n            for message in messages\n                body = message.body.replace(/</g, \"&lt;\").replace(/>/g, \"&gt;\")  # Escape html tags in body\n                @addLine \"<b>#{message.cert_user_id}</b>: #{body}\"\n```\n\n\n## Final touches\n\n- We can remove the site siteInfo and serverInfo debug messages:\n\n```coffeescript\n    onOpenWebsocket: (e) =>\n        @cmd \"siteInfo\", {}, (site_info) =>\n            # Update currently selected username\n            if site_info.cert_user_id\n                document.getElementById(\"select_user\").innerHTML = site_info.cert_user_id\n            @site_info = site_info  # Save site info data to allow access it later\n        @loadMessages()\n```\n\n- Send messages by hitting Enter:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"message\" onkeypress=\"if (event.keyCode == 13) Page.sendMessage()\">\n```\n\n- And add some CSS style to make it look better\n\n```html\n<style>\n* { font-family: monospace; line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: middle; }\nbody { background-color: white; }\ninput#message { padding: 5px; width: 50%; height: 34px; }\ninput#send { height: 34px; margin-left: -2px; }\nul { padding: 0px; }\nli { list-style-type: none; border-top: 1px solid #eee; padding: 5px 0px; }\nli:nth-child(odd) { background-color: #F9FAFD; }\nli b { color: #3F51B5; }\n</style> \n```\n\n- **After you edited any file never forget to sign and publish the modifications!**\n\n```\nzeronet.py siteSign [your site address] --publish\n```\n\n## Congratulations! Now you have a server-less, pure P2P, SQL backed chat application! :)\n\n<style>\n .post .body { font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: Arial; }\n .post .body pre code { line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 80%; }\n code { font-size: 75% }\n</style>"

			"body": "This tutorial demonstrates how to create a simple, multi-user, p2p chat ZeroNet application.\n\nIn this, first part we going to create a new site then add some simple html and javascript that interact to the ZeroNet client using the ZeroFrame API.\n\n\n## Creating a new site\n\n - Open a console in your ZeroNet directory\n - Execute `zeronet.py siteCreate` command (or `..\\python\\python.exe zeronet.py siteCreate` if you using ZeroBundle package)\n - A new site will be created for you and the private key is displayed in the console window. **Save it, you can only modify your site using this key.**\n - Type: `yes`\n\nThat's it! Your site should be on the ZeroHello screen. \n\nNow lets fill it with content...\n\n---\n\n## Start ZeroNet in debug mode\nThis is _optional_, but recommended, because the tutorial (and all sample) code is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). \nThe debug mode features automatic coffeescript -> javascript conversion, so you don't have to do it manually.\n- Close ZeroNet\n- Start ZeroNet using `zeronet.py --debug` command\n\n_(note: the coffeescript compiler bundled for windows, if you are in different platform you have to install it using `npm install -g coffee-script`)_\n\n\n## Edit index.html\nCreate a simple html structure to display the messages:\n\n- Navigate to data/[yoursiteaddress]\n- Edit **index.html**:\n\n```\n<html>\n<body>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"message\"><input type=\"button\" id=\"send\" value=\"Send!\"/>\n<ul id=\"messages\">\n <li>Welcome to ZeroChat!</li>\n</ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## The first ZeroFrame API calls\n\n_Note: To disable browser's caching keep the JavaScript console opened (F12)_\n\nThe [ZeroFrame API](http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/) allows you to query server/site/user info, load or modify files using a WebSocket connection to your ZeroNet client.\n\nCreate **js** and a **js/lib** directories then download and copy [ZeroFrame.coffee](data/files/ZeroFrame.coffee) file to **js/lib**, this helps using the [ZeroFrame API](http://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/)\n- Create **js/ZeroChat.coffee** file with following content:\n\n```\nclass ZeroChat extends ZeroFrame\n    init: ->\n        @addLine \"inited!\"\n        \n    addLine: (line) ->\n        messages = document.getElementById(\"messages\")\n        messages.innerHTML = \"<li>#{line}</li>\"+messages.innerHTML\n        \n\n    # Wrapper websocket connection ready\n    onOpenWebsocket: (e) =>\n        @cmd \"serverInfo\", {}, (server_info) =>\n            @addLine \"serverInfo response: <pre>\" + JSON.stringify(server_info,null,2) + \"</pre>\"\n        @cmd \"siteInfo\", {}, (site_info) =>\n            @addLine \"siteInfo response: <pre>\" + JSON.stringify(site_info,null,2) + \"</pre>\"\n\nwindow.Page = new ZeroChat()\n```\nThis code will query all info about the site and the server (your ZeroNet client) right after websocket connection is ready, then add the result as json formatted text to messages html node.\n- Add `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/all.js\" async></script>` line right before `</body>` in index.html file to automatically compile and merge all .coffee file within the **js** directory to a single all.js file.\n\n- If everything went well it should look like this:\n\n![Tutorial](data/img/tutorial-1.png)\nAnd you should have the following directory structure:\n```\ndata/[your site address]\n├─ js/\n│  ├─ lib/\n│  │  └─ ZeroFrame.coffee\n│  ├─ ZeroChat.coffee\n│  └─ all.js\n├── index.html\n└── content.json\n```\n\n- Every time you finish the modifications on your site you have to **sign** and **publish** the new content using the `zeronet.py siteSign [yoursiteaddress] --publish` command\n\n<style>\n .post .body { font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: Arial; }\n .post .body pre code { line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 80%; }\ncode { font-size: 75% }\n</style>"

(eg. remove misbehaving users)\n\nOther info\n\n - ZeroID is a standard site, anyone can clone it and have his/her own one\n - You can stop seeding ZeroID site after you got your cert"
