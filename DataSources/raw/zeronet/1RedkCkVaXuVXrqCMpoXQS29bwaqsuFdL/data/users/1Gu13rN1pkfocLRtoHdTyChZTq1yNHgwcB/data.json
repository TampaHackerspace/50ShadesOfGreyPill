			"body": "So after deliberating on whether or not to recreate the written work about games here for ZeroNet, what I think I'm going to to instead is publish my assorted essays on the act of writing itself. They aren't really well crafted essays or ones given the same kind of care and attention that I give to my game essays, but they help me work through issues I come across in the writing process and kind of help clear my head when motivation to write can be hard to come by.\n\nIn the next few days I hope to start posting some I've already written unedited, following with some future essays. I'll probably copy an existing blog and repurpose it. I can't promise there will be frequent updates, but I'll chime in from time to time.",
