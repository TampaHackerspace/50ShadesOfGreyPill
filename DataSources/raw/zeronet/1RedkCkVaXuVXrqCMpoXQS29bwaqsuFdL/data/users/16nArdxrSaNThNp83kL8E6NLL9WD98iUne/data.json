A distributed torrent site should be able to accommodate something like that. And for those worrying about censorship, I'm pretty sure there will be plenty of people willing to seed the NSFW hubs :)\n\nThe other benefit to having the torrents in hubs is that it emphasizes the fact that anybody could create their own torrent site front-end and then tap into the same hubs. This also solves the issues that some sites like ZeroTorrent have had where a user would run out of their allowed space on the site preventing them from making more uploads. With a hub system the user could simply switch to a different hub and continue uploading without having to hope that the creator of whatever site will up the user space allotment.",

Any existing tools either rely on installing a local app or using a third-party API that goes through the clearnet.\n\nIf you really want convenient translation, just get any of the many existing addons for Chrome and Firefox. I personally prefer \"S3.Google Translator\" for Firefox as it provides simple select-click-and-translate functionality, with the translation appearing in a nice popup that I can tweak the results with. Sure it sends the text to Google, but it's better than no translation.",

And besides, I don't like the idea that stuff is simply thrown away(which is why I support things like Archive.org). People should have the option to keep things backed up. Setting files as optional would be clean and solve the space issue for most people that don't want older files. Perhaps adding an ability to ZeroNet that lets you easily cleanup optional files that are older than a certain number of days would also be useful for people that don't want to keep really old things around. It'd also be nice if I could choose which optional files to keep around, so I could say keep all the text around but delete the pictures which hog a lot of space.",
