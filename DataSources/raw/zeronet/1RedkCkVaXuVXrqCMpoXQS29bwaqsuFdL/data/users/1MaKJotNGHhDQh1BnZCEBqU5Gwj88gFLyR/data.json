This way I'll always have 500 image files that may or may not change depending on two things:\n- a book in the shard (one with id%500==0) changes.\n- a new book (new id) is added to the shard.\n\nI know it's not a perfect solution, but it assures an almost perfect distribution of books between shards, hence having shards 'mostly' same sized.

That will 'orphan' your bloxel and it will be rejected by the other players in favor of the lesser (aka 'more difficult to mine') offset.\nThe fact that I'm not doing more strict checking in the code could change in the next versions.
