Also I'm trying very hard but I can not make it say April 31st as a date no matter what I do, at least in a current version of LibreOffice's spreadsheet.\nPerhaps Vlad should stop drinking the wodka while he is at work.",

However, it is far more beneficial to talk about these actual deficiencies in a way that will make the development community aware of them so they may get resolved in one of their next updates (oh yeah MS products don't receive regular updates from a development community that can quickly address strange issues drunk slavs uncover at work)",
