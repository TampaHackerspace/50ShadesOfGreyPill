Also they are talking about breaking encryption/building backdoors. Once they notice that more people start using VPN/TOR to protect their privacy, they will find a terrorist that uses this software and ban it, too.\n\n10 years ago people here said that only dictatures like China surveill the internet. You were called paranoid if you said that the USA would do it too. Thanks to Snowden we all know it but everyone shrugs their shoulders. No protests. People here are too lazy, passive and uninterested - as long as they do not ban fast food, football, cars, beer and iPhones no one will care. ",

Did they give any specific reason for why they cancelled (apart from blabla right time, I mean why did they contact you in the first place?) \n\nTED are possibly worried about something that could negatively affect their image. My theories:\n\n1. Is it the bunch fascists/homophobes/antisemites on the promoted ZeroTalk  site who would totally screw ZeroNets (and TED's) image? I mean everyone who visits ZeroNet for the first time goes to the default sites first, and if they see some nazi crap right on the first page they may just leave without digging deeper. And TED obviously would not promote something that looks at the first glance like a fascist forum.\n2. file sharing\n3.
