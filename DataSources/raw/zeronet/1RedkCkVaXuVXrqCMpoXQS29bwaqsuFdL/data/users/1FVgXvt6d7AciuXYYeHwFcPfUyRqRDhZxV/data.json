I know it's a lot to ask in a short period of time, but it's a good feature that really should exist in any good social media platform. (If it already exists and I just haven't seen it yet, disregard this message.)\n\nEdit: Also perhaps add posts to the activity feed in addition to comments? I'd like to know when someone makes a post.",
