Want to donate?\n- **Centralized Approval:** An imperial order by the site moderators.\n\nTo proof yourself in a distributed network, you have to give out some information that is not only unique to your state but also easy for everyone to check.\n\nThings to check:\n1. The peer is following the common rules.\n2. The peer has given out information that can reliably imply what we want it to have.\n\nExample: Decentralized CAPTCHA\n1. The peer is generating legit CAPTCHAs. It is not generating random, illegible noises. It is not reusing old CAPTCHAs.\n2. Solving the CAPTCHA using a computer is hard, but checking the answer is easy. In this way, giving out the answer implies that a real human being, rather than spammer bots, is writing a post. Everyone can effectively conclude that, because it is easy to check the validity of an answer.\n\nProblem with a Decentralized CAPTCHA idea on ZeroTalk:\n1.

			"body": "An Open Question to Every ZeroNet Contributor\n\n## How to maintain a reasonable balance between storage availability and data availability, using algorithms?\n\n(Updated)\n\nWhen I read the homepage of bit.no.com, the ZeroNet proxy, I noticed that the proxy found more peers than my own ZeroNet client did. When I clicked on my ZeroMux website to see the peers bit.no.com found, I saw many points that I could not find on my own map. I believe that those extra points were computers that were no longer reachable. (Correction: peer list is updated every 1~4 hours)\n\nSeveral days ago, the owner of https://onlyzero.net/ , a ZeroNet proxy, received a takedown complaint from a Hong Kong company, forcing the site owner to take down a software cracking site hosted on the proxy. This complaint is the first takedown complaint that makes us be aware of peer reliability in ZeroNet.\n\nZeroNet chooses which optional file to recycle according to the number of peers the file has. ZeroNet may have included the peers that are \"dead,\" unreachable and very slow, or have other incorrect assumptions on peer reliability. To make a more accurate calculation, ZeroNet's corresponding algorithm should apply a weight to every peer.\n\n### How to define the weight?\nConcerns:\n- We cannot rely on peers that are \"dead,\" slow and unlikely to **contribute**.\n- We cannot rely too much on **major seeders**. When someone tries to take down certain content, he or she will take down the major seeders first.\n\nAspects to take in, including but not limited to:\n- **Connectivity:** the \"ping\" value of a peer __(but adds to data transfer)__; the speed a peer __(but has insufficient data)__; the ratio of the number of successful connections to the number of all connections made __(requires bigger sample size)__.\n- **Contribution:** recent contributions of a peer, observed by ZeroNet itself. __(but varies with respect to network environment)__.\n- **Location Diversity:** preserve data availability when massive Internet censorship takes place __(but this paranoid factor consumes much computational power)__.\n\nMathematical Fairness:\n- Since we cannot rely too much on major seeders, the weight should not be greater than 1. This cut off avoids over-evaluating big seeding peers.\n- Since ZeroNet evaluates data availability based on its observation of its own network environment, ZeroNet may run into some false positives. We should also find a way to cross validate evaluations. (Hard)\n\nSimple Explanation:\n- 1 slow peer = 0.5 normal peer\n- 1 very slow peer = 0.25 normal peer\n- 1 fast peer = 1 normal peer (reduce major seeder dependency)\n- 1 very fast peer = 1 normal peer (reduce major seeder dependency)\n\n### Viability\nCalculating the weight defined above requires a lot of information, and it is costly to gather all these information only to calculate weights. Perhaps we can take a more heuristic approach, at the beginning, assuming all peers has a weight of 0.9, and changing the weight value when latest information is available.\n\nThis algorithm may be too paranoid, but it can be helpful when there are disruptions targeting the ZeroNetwork going on.",

			"body": "### How to share files privately over ZeroNet (with ZeroMux)\n\nPrinciples:\n1. Data confidentiality. Privacy matters.\n2. Completely over ZeroNet. You can share files via other means, but that is not the focus of this tutorial.\n\nSteps:\n1. _Key Agreement:_ send a ZeroMail to your friend, exchange your encryption keys. The protocol of ZeroNet is robust enough to protect data integrity. If you think ZeroMail is unsafe (which is really not the case), you can ask your friend to use public key encryption.\n\n2. _Encryption:_ Encrypt your file with external tools. 7-Zip / PeaZip / GPG\n\n3. _Chunking and Signing:_ Set up your ZeroMux site.\n\n4. _Download:_ Send a ZeroMail to your friend. Tell him your site address, so that he can download the file. Keep this address private. Remember to tell your friend to inform you when he finishes downloading and verifying your file.\n\n5. _Clean up:_ Simply delete your site.\n\nQuick Questions:\n1. _Q:_ Will the trackers know my site address?\n    _A:_ No. Your address will always be hashed before it is posted to the trackers.\n\n2. _Q:_ How can data integrity be ensured?\n    _A:_ Data integrity is ensured via the digital signature algorithm used by Bitcoin.\n\n3. _Q:_ Why do I need to encrypt my file?\n    _A:_ ZeroNet protocol cannot protect data confidentiality against active attackers.\n\n4. _Q:_ What about port forwarding?\n    _A:_ Such technique requires the file hosting peer have open ports for incoming connections. It is recommended that both of you use Tor Hidden Service mode.\n\n5. _Q:_ What about traffic correlation attacks?\n    _A:_ Because you are sending out a large amount of data, you might be susceptible to traffic correlation attacks, which can be used to deanonymize you. Deliberately throttling the upload bandwidth of Python interpreter might mitigate traffic correlation attack. I2P integration might also mitigate this attack. (This is why I2P support is important)",

The Dark Net support of RetroShare is **limited** and **hard to configure.** RetroShare requires the user to create a Tor Hidden service or a I2P server tunnel in order to use the Dark Net mode. The only parameters you can change in RetroShare is its listen address and the proxy address it wants to use for outgoing connections.\n\nI am using PurpleI2P, and I followed their [tutorial](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/wiki/Using-with-Retroshare) of creating a I2P hidden service. \n`RetroShare => xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.b32.i2p:51111`\n\nI can verify it with python http server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 51111` and put that tunnel address in the address bar.\n\nPerhaps I can create another server tunnel via this manual method and let ZeroNet use it. Too bad there are no I2P trackers added and there aren't any other peers out there.",

I understand that ZeroNet lacked a media sharing platform, and that big file support was too complicated to fit ZeroNet's architecture at that time.\n\nIf you have ever read through the issue page of ZeroNet, you would have noticed, ZeroMux is actually an implementation of PR [#521](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/pull/521) on application level. I decided to make it JS, because at that time, there was a [huge](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet?tab=overview&from=2016-06-06) [blank area](https://github.com/shortcutme?tab=overview&from=2016-06-06) on ZeroNet's activity graph.\n\nAttempts to make ZeroNet great again have been made by many people, mostly encouraged by this extended period of inactivity. Early developers at that time, @Lola: made ZeroTube, @Bwoi: and @PaintNinja: made the very first music sites on ZeroNet, @Tkarita: who had worked and left first used \"ZeroNet big file loader\" to share PDF ebooks, and @Eibriel: who came later but became a productive blogger integrated IPFS in his blog. None of them focused on changing ZeroNet's source code, because such ambition of file sharing was way ahead of its time. Urging ZeroNet's sole developer would not work.\n\nThanks to the hardworking of NoFish and 50+ contributors, now ZeroNet is just a few patches away to support big files at its basic level. It might be ridiculous to you that we early ZeroNet users were working so hard on attempts that look awkward and stupid today, but remember, those are the efforts of us, early developers, to keep ZeroNet alive and make ZeroNet great.",
