			"body": "Hi all,\n\nI ran across ZeroNet in the past, just had another look at it again. It is interesting and has the potential to spawn a new community (easy anonymity + hosting), but what exactly is this community doing?\n\n\nI am a software engineer, and would be up for helping with development/organizational tasks, but in general most of the topics here are either random news, troll posts, tests, and official ZeroNet announcements.\n\n\nGranted, this is the only board I've looked at so far, but where can I find more living members? :P Are you guys on IRC?\n\n\nIt's a neat idea, but given the target demographic you guys will have a very difficult time whitelisting constructive content. Otherwise this will just turn into another internet cesspool, with the users actually doing interesting things staying stealthy and undetected, while all of the 10-16 year olds that know reddit exists will spam cat pictures and troll posts.\n\n\nWhere are the serious discussions about securing our anonymity? The serious discussions about preventing/escaping WW3/shit hitting the fan? The serious discussions about ways to make money and survive in this corrupt capitalist system? Or at least, you know, tips? Maybe programming/ZN integration tutorials? Ideas on what to use ZN for?\n\n\nEtc. Just thought I'd drop in; I like what you guys are doing, and would like to be a part of it, but there is no clear focus that I can see. Anonymity/tech alone is not enough, the actual technology/implementation is but one part.\n\n\nCheers",
