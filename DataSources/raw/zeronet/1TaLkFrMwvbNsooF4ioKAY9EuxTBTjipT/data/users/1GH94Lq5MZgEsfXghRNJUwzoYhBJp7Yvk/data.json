They are only united in their hate against gentiles.\nWestern European and American Jewish rabbis with Jewish financiers decided to fund Israel.\nEastern and Middle European Jews didn't want to leave their country, because they were very well integrated in their environment.\nThe Rothschild family with the most influential rabbis could have decided to sacrifice six million East European Jews who didn't want to leave Europe to fulfill the prophecy.\nThose Jews who agreed to leave Europe and fund Israel received help.\nThey are many proofs that Jews have influenced, financed and helped Hitler.",
