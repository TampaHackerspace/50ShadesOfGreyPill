Zip and unzipped the ZeroNet-master folder underneath. Then rename the ZeroNet-master folder to ZeroNet, enter the folder, then open the zeronet.py file with npp or other editor, and add the following two lines under `import sys` and save\n\n```python\nfrom thread import stack_size\nstack_size(32768)\n```\n\nIn the current directory and then create a new zeronet.conf file, enter the following and save:\n\n```\n[global]\nui_ip = 192.168.123.1\n```\n\nThen open the ZeroNet\\src\\lib\\opensslVerify\\opensslVerify.py file, line 203, add the following two lines:\n\n```\n        elif os.path.isfile(\"/opt/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\"): # Router\n            dll_path = \"/opt/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\"\n```\n\nModify the completion function style as follows\n\n```\ndef openLibrary():\n    global ssl\n    try:\n        if sys.platform.startswith(\"win\"):\n            dll_path = os.path.dirname(__file__) + \"/\" + \"libeay32.dll\"\n        elif sys.platform == \"cygwin\":\n            dll_path = \"/bin/cygcrypto-1.0.0.dll\"\n        elif os.path.isfile(\"../lib/libcrypto.so\"): # ZeroBundle OSX\n            dll_path = \"../lib/libcrypto.so\"\n        elif os.path.isfile(\"/opt/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\"): # Router\n            dll_path = \"/opt/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\"\n        else:\n            dll_path = \"/usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.so\"\n        ssl = _OpenSSL(dll_path)\n        assert ssl\n    except Exception, err:\n        ssl = _OpenSSL(ctypes.util.find_library('ssl') or ctypes.util.find_library('crypto') or ctypes.util.find_library('libcrypto') or 'libeay32')\n    logging.debug(\"opensslVerify loaded: %s\", ssl._lib)\n```\n\nBack in ssh, execute these command\n\n```shell\ncd ZeroNet\ntmux\n```\n\nThis will be displayed as follows:\n\n![1484830120.png (774x374)](data/img/post_1_1484830120.png)​​​​​​​\n\nThen enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\nWait finished,then type`python zeronet.py`and enter.\nNow, open your browser and go to [http://192.168.123.1:43110/](http://192.168.123.1:43110/).\n\n![1484830875.jpg (1064x857)](data/img/post_1_1484830875.jpg)\n\n：）enjoy it",

Thanks 12hlearn -  It's a great guide on how to run ZeroNet off a USB drive attached directly to your router (if your router supports it).\n> Having said that, I'd suggest running ZeroNet on a stand-alone device instead. A Raspberry Pi would be much more suitable, or even an old PC you have lying around - Chuck your preferred flavor of Linux on there, setup your VPN, then chuck it in the corner and let it seed away. This way you have a little more control over Bandwidth and traffic allowances (for those people that still have to operate within peak/off-peak times).\n\nI agree with you,  but everyone have a router, Raspberry Pi not...",

If we can find way to bundle all dependencies as we do for python ZeroNet, we can also port php Apps even Ruby on Rails Apps to ZeroNet. I don't think we can easily build a ZeroNet-native discourse from scratch because there are tons of features and tweaks to do. ( I just use discourse as an example)Another thing worthy considering: what if import existing discourse forum to ZeroNet? Extremely difficult if no porting because of the huge difference of structure. The use case: Alice has no money to pay the hosting fee for her existing discourse forum, Bob suffers DDOS to his existing discourse forum, both of them wants to import their own sites to ZeroNet.\n\nit's diffcult to do...that discourse Hardware Requirements :\n\n* Dual core CPU recommended\n* 1 GB RAM minimum (with swap)\n* 64 bit Linux compatible with Docker\n\nmeans a lot of device like raspberry pi , router, 32 bit computer, openvz vm, IOT, and other can't run it...not really decentralized",
