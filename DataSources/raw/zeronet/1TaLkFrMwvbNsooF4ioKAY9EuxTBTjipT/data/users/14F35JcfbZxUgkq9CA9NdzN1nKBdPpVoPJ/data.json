Packages like Algo and Streisand hold your hand through the entire process, and having a your own host avoids being blocked by VPN blacklists. Sans promotion, I think OVH has the cheapest machines out of the big providers, but it lacks support for automatically deploying machines with the aforementioned packages.",
