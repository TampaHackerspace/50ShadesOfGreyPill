However, you may want to make an alias to start zeronet, otherwise you'll need to  point your terminal to the Zeronet-master folder to start. more info on that here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/17536/how-do-i-create-a-permanent-bash-alias\n> I have no experience with Mint, but I do like Ubuntu.

Yes, they are similar but ZeroIndex would be a way to easily find content you didn't know you wanted.\n\nZeroSearch is a good idea but it needs a way to search for media formats like JPG, TIF, PNG, GIF and BMP for images and AVI, WMV, MP4, MOV and MPEG for video. It also needs a way to display them like Google and Yahoo does. Both Google and Yahoo have a video search and a image search and ZeroSearch needs something similar. \n\nZeroIndex is also a good idea though. It would be nice if ZeroSearch and ZeroIndex could be used together. ZeroIndex could be used to index everything and then you could use ZeroSearch to search through the ZeroIndex folders. \nExample -  You index a blog about nature on ZeroIndex and give it tags like nature, blog and landscapes, then people can use ZeroSearch and type in nature or landscape and ZeroSearch searches through ZeroIndex and brings up anything with those tags.",

Also, yeah, ZeroSearch needs a way to find sites, which is the thing I'm trying to fix with Zeroindex. Google is able to crawl to pages, because very rarely is a page linked nowhere. However, pages are linked nowhere a lot in ZeroNet, and there is no site crawler for it yet. That means a lot of interesting content, say about nature, seen only by the visitors to that site, and not by someone who posts nature to ZeroSearch.\n\nI think you would have to give ZeroIndex a search box and when someone searches for a tag like nature,  you could have ZeroIndex programmed to exclude the sites you already have and only show the ones you don't have.",

Those millions of people who just want to click a button and have their content appear on the page. Markdown is fine, as we see people on reddit use it just fine despite having no coding experience. However, how many of those users would, say, be comfortable digging into the html and javascript of a site to customize it? Hell, even a lot of reddit moderators don't care to do that and just copy+paste important stuff they like (full themes, generators for stuff, etc).\n> And back in the day with myspace we saw a similar thing happen. People visited site generators to theme their site, rather than digging into the html/js. I see ZeroNet quite similarly to how Myspace or even something like Geocities was back in the day: where everyone has their own little site customized to their taste.\n> However, I do see this as an opportunity to educate people on how stuff actually works, and get them digging into code and learning about how websites work, rather than continue to rely on buttons.\n> All that being said, I love markdown. It's fantastic. It should honestly be a standard.\n\nBut don't forget some of us love the buttons but hate to code. ZeroNet needs to cater to both, coders and non-coders. The non-coders can use the CMS while coders could still code what they want. I think of ZeroNet as more of a Product and not a Project. If you want the Consumer to use a product you have to cater to their needs and wants. I love what nofish has created but it does need a CMS. I believe a CMS will get more consumers, who can't code or don't want to code, to use ZeroNet.",

Given that there is already a Blogging app created (althought still crude). I wanted to port my wiki to this. I think I did a good job, althought it took me a bit of json encoding knowledge and some manual edits to get it right. Fortunately is working now. Maybe a plugin to export a wp blog into JSON format.\n\nCheck out https://sandstorm.io/ They have a wordpress app & I believe you might be able to set wordpress up to post on ZeroNet as a static site.",

I think it can be done like running IRC bots in a ZeroChat, users could run a bot for other users to play, and maybe the Zite could build in graphics for bots.\n> A lot of bots come up when you do a search these are the ones that peaked my interest but need to be ported to javascript and made to work in ZeroChat:\n> https://casinobot.codeplex.com/http://javatwg.sourceforge.net/\n> I'm also seeing bots for twitch.tv that as viewers watch a streamer the bot gives them currency and they can gamble the currency.

You could have a decent session, but would need to clean the previous sessions to save space.For poker you could just rely on json files, thou skipping the database doesn't really save much.(actually, ZeroMail is huge and runs fine, so i might be overstating the issue)Other than that, it's basically doable.
