The thing is, there are so many problems all over the world, wars, hunger, a big percent of young people in Western societies have no job and people have their own \"smaller\" problems. I think that definitely most of people don't consider privacy to be really important (even that it's considered a human right) and it's why almost nothing changed.",

You have exactly what you need and nothing more. You don't have to compile anything on server, you can do that through network. And Gentoo is a really reliable operating system, contrary to Arch Linux.",

You really should have original videos on a hard drive in your home or something similar, a drive you have physical access to. Not only because of possible takedown but also because YouTube may reduce quality of videos quite significantly during upload, even when it keeps original resolution. Good that you decided to distribute your videos to other video sharing sites. As @ulrichard said IPFS as a backup is an awesome idea too. ZeroNet is more for websites than sharing big files, as far as I know.",
