As for a dick.... certainly if she were MTF then she'd have gotten surgery? I swear some people are just too retarded to actually use their brain.\n\nMy best respect for Michael/Michelle Obama.\nThey are different kind of sexual modifications/reassignments. As seen in the video he/she could have penis even if the testicles are removed and the female hormones are taken to make the breasts grow.\nIn whatever transition stage is legally considered a person male or female in one country or another the biological sex is more connected to the genetically defined sex. People are understandable confused now but in everyday language they still tend to use the biological sex.\nHow would you call those with penis and tits but removed testicles ?\nHow would you call those with removed penis but intact testicles ?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qvNvnPK1wk\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penectomy",
