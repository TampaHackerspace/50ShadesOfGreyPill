This use case will make people use more zeronet, hence more zero web pages in ecosystem.\n2. create something like zero.net framework so we can utilize zeronet and build apps/games on it(that would be very cool).\n3. zeronet on mobile (android, iOS).\n4. make it possible to limit my upload bandwith(don't know is it already possible)\n5. try to create alternative to any current popular app (facebook,reedit,youtube, google), and popular API-s.",
