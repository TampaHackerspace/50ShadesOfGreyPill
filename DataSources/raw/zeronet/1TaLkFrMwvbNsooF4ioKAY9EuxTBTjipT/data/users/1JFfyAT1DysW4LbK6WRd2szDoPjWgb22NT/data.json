				"body": "Hillary, the pathological liar, the enabler of Bill's sexcapades and the Butcher of Benghazi sold access to the State Department to the highest bidder through the Clinton Crime Foundation using her private e-mail server. How could anyone vote for this whore of Babylon? Moreover, Hillary is suffering from late stage Parkinson's disease. She's been given about a year to live. She is truly unfit to be President. Who do you want a blood clot away from the Presidency? It certainly isn't Tim Kaine.\nFrankly, how could anyone vote for any Democrats at all after they railroaded Obamacare through Congress and forced 70% of the American people to pay for it whether they wanted it or not? Coming soon, huge premium increases to keep this disaster afloat. \nVOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nVOTE REPUBLICAN! MAKE THE DEMOCRATS PAY FOR THEIR ARROGANCE!",
