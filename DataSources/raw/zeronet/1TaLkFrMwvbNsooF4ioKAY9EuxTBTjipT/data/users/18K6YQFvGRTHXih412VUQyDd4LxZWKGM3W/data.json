				"body": "The Jews were driven to extinction ~19 centuries ago, and their identity was stolen by cultists of the demon Beelzebub (who they call \"Moloch\"). They had tried it once before, but Moses had them slaughtered. Unfortunately, he spared the last few survivors, giving the cultists a chance to take over more gradually.\nThey're now known as the Pharisees. Jesus publicly spoke out against them, denouncing them as liars and murderers. They responded by lying about Him and then murdering Him, and then hunting down and murdering His followers.\nThe destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD was the end of Judaism. The former Jews either sold their souls and became Pharisees, or repented of their sins and became Christians, and were subsequently murdered by the Pharisees.\n\nMuslims and Pharisees are both Arabs (they're very close genetically), and they both worship a demon who commands them to rape children. (\"Moloch\"/the Talmud says \"between one day over 3 years old and one day under 9 years old\", and \"Allah\"/the Quran says \"at least 9 years old\"; collusion?)\n\"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\" (Matthew 18:6)\nSimply removing them from the civilized world is not enough; learn from Moses' mistake and do not spare even one of them.",
