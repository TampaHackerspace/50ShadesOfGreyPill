More directly, it’s a way of reminding ourselves that we can find greater meaning in every single aspect of our lives–even, well, poop.\nhttp://thejewniverse.com/2011/everybody-poops/\n\nVulgar Jewess Sarah Silverman has basically built a whole career on her various bodily functions. The following are the infantile lyrics from a song she sings called The Poop Song:\nIt was brown and it had raisins\nAnd we flushed it for that reason\nThis is who your daughters have to look up to\nThis is a poop song\nThis is a poop song\nI was walking through the mall\nAnd I had to make a poop\nThis is a poop song\nThis is a poop song\nWe pooped at the mall today\nWe pooped at the mall\n",
