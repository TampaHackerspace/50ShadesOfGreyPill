If non-Nazis actually write highly upvoted posts, then the Nazis will get downvoted to heck.\n> Additionally, I want to be allowed to choose which content I do and do not share with others. I have no desire to be seeding anti-Semitic bullshit to others.\n\nAh but downvotes prevent me from seeing messages others don't like. Bad.",
