What had Obama's killing and torture of over one million people in Irak, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya to do with Nobel prize for peace ? Simply he worked for Jews and was rewarded.\nBob Dylan (Hebrew name: Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham)  was born as Robert Allen Zimmerman and raised Jewish in Wisconsin, Dylan has maintained Israel ties throughout his life.). \nHe was Jew and he hated Gentile.\nIs this not enough to get Nobel prize and one million $?\nBut how genial. Why should the Jews pay for their mercenaries from their own pocket if they can bribe the Nobel Committee for less and save the money.",
