Because the mobile's storage capacity is too small. We must consider a sufficient number of personal computers to form a basic network. To have enough people to use zeronet, in order to have enough personal computers to form the underlying network.\n\nTo attract enough people to use, first you must  have an attractive thing. Zerotalk is ok. And the development of zerotalk technology has all have, upload pictures, embed video, set up the administrator, just need to integrate it.\n\nThis does not require Packing a bitcoin, ipfs, namecoin, etc. into one big, monolithic application.\n\nIf zerotalk builds a basic network, there is a technical problem that has not yet been solved, and the establishment and maintenance of large-scale P2P database. I think this is the real problem and development of zeronet will face to.\n\nFor example, from 100000 personal computers constitute zeronet basic network, each computer to take 30G hard drive capacity, 100000X30G = 3000T. So big a P2P database, how to build? How to run How to maintain This is the real problem.\n\nOnce zeronet can build a stable base network, the number of personal computers will be far more than 100,000 units. On this basis, is to consider when the mobile to join.\n\nBefore the foundation network is established, no matter how smart a person is, no matter how much favorite protocol can increase, will not succeed.",

Also, streaming data instead of downloading is becoming more popular (like Netflix/Spotify/Youtube), so being able to do some amount of that is a good idea too.\n> \n> That example isn't totally right. A network can be very redundant, or have high capacity, but having more of one means having less of the other. You can have more of each, but that's much harder. (this page explains it a little more).\n> For example, if there was only one site with a size of 30GB, then the whole network can only store 30GB. I know it's not really like that--but in the real network, just adding up the storage of each device isn't correct.\n\nI know that mobile phone applications are more extensive, but by the personal computer constitute a basic network is more feasible. The advantage of P2P networks lies in the storage space of a large number of personal computers. If you do not make full use of the personal computer's spare storage space, compared with the internet network there is no advantage. Mobile phone can be connected to the server, there is no need to use zeronet.\n\nStreaming data is good idea, but too much attention to it is not necessary. Twister is to rely entirely on streaming data, the result is not received posts. Of course, this problem can be solved, to reduce the distribution of old posts in the node on the line, but this again complicated the problem.\n\nI can see from your reply, you also know that a huge P2P database operation and maintenance is a difficult point.（But having more of one means having less of the other. You can have more of each, but that's much harder.）",

(besides any favorites we might have) This is not a failing of nofish to create a set of uniform zites for people to get started, but for people who stay here there are issues with this design.\n> For example, the working proxy sites with their long lists on ZeroHello are a good gateway, perhaps better than a static list since we can see popularity and know what is alive and updated. But 0lists a like hitting \"I feel lucky\" on Google. We end up with many crappy random half-loaded zites with few or no peers, and then have to go through our ZeroHello deleting the mess again. So for me the homepage is the bottleneck.

Since then main zite developer have been few (except nofish/zerome) but having more zites like just posted allows us to merge layout and start thinking about admin features for true CMS. The main collaboration so far has been code sharing (cloning) rather than joint effort on single projects. That will surely happen as zites get busier and more complex.\n> Also curious and waiting to hear details of nofish's new announcement as mentioned in the dev blog, if it pertains (has relevance) to any of this.\n\nI uploaded a picture, your picture becomes three.

In the future zeronet with more people, you can advertise. On the left one can put ads.\n\nMaybe big companies will buy your start-up business, you can make a lot of money.\n\nFirst of all, let a lot of people come in. Put zerotalk with image well, many people come in. This will be a successful business.\n\nIf you can win the venture capital, full-time development of your zerotalk with image and your app center, you have enough technical ability to be more likely to be successful. Your zerotalk with image the better development, the more people will use, your app center portal can do the better, the easier for you to win the venture capital.\n\nGo yahoo boss for entrepreneurial funds, he is doing the portal site success.

It's taken some time to fully understand your requests, but i do finally get your meaning. It's not your English, but thinking about the Chinese sites i've visited it makes sense. At this stage it's useful to hear your opinion how to integrate well.\n> Anyway, as far as i can tell (based on the top proxies) it looks like Chinese users will outnumber English user sometime soon. Language is one issue. Even now, i want to link to Chinese content creators but it needs mouse-over which translates title, etc. Also, Unicode handling..\n> Uncaught InvalidCharacterError: Failed to execute: The string to be encoded contains characters outside of the Latin1 range.\n> Just reading Tamas' announcement about TED talk on the dev blog.\n\nI hope you soon succeed, you succeeded my aim has also been achieved, so that millions of Chinese people use zeronet.\n\nThe faster you succeed, the happier I am.\n\nTo quickly achieve success, it is necessary to develop a Chinese people like to use the APP. I studied it, zerotak with image the most appropriate. Than zerome easy to develop, suitable for Chinese people like to do their own group, all the technology has been, and only need to integrate, you can succeed.\n\nZeronet development has three major difficulties, large P2P database is one of them. Zerome from the beginning to face this difficulty is not wise. Zeotalk with image to avoid this difficulty, but the same effect.\n\nZerotalk with image can be displayed on the home page img, can upload video, can set the administrator, there will be a lot of people cloning, there will be a lot of people use, so that your portal on the success, there may be large companies Buy your company.",
