Kudos to the developers and supporters.\n\n/** Shameless plug =) */\nI'm part of the coreteam of a similar project called Sneer (https://github.com/sneerteam/sneer). For now we just have an Android client but web and desktop clients are coming out this year. The main client is a chat app similar to Telegram, Signal, etc, and it's possible to develop plugins that we call SneerApps, to extend it's functionality, make games, so on so forth. \n\nWe are still using a central server but we plan to go P2P sometime in the future. You can check our (outdated) roadmap here: https://trello.com/b/lEdEIxxA/sneer.\n\nCheers!",
