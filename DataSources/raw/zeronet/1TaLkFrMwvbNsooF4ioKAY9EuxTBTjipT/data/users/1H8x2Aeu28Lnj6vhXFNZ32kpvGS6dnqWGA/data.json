All primary counties that house sanctuary cities with little to no voting laws. \n\nCalifornia even acknowledges that 13% of illegals vote, as they also do not require Social Security Numbers or Driver License Numbers.

It's not even just about their being concentrated cities with high populations, its the fact it is so easy to manipulate and pad voting numbers from the voting populations from the lack of voting laws. \n\nThank God some states are now going to make Voting IDs mandatory now thanks to some of the fraud uncovered from the recount.",

Absolutely wonderful (and futuristic).\n\nWhen it comes to ZeroME - the normal app server seems to have a few posts that aren't in the proxy server so you might want to look into that. (zeronet.korso.win/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/). Also you might look into some graphical fixes with the extended text box - http://i.imgur.com/Qyv0Jxn.png - make it white and not just transparent and put it on a higher layer then the thing on the right, as well as make the attack image move with the moved corner.\n\nZeroMail doesn't seem to work for me and it gives me \"1 file update failed\" if i try to update it.\n\nApart from that, good work! Hopefully we'll see more fun sites in the future, too~",

The best future is this becoming the normal internet, since websites can still be moderated by their admins so we can totally have proper content, while still allowing for freedom cause anyone can host whatever website they want.",

Of course, freedom is a major aspect of the 0net.\n\nHowever a bit part of it is going to be the fact that website admins can still monitor and, well, administrate the content of their own websites, and still hire moderators. Chances are, since most people are actually decent human beings, when it comes to major websites like reddit clones and what not, we are going to see standard moderation when it comes to spam or raids and the like while still having freedom of speech (depending on the moderation, which is still a whole new area to explore later in the life of 0net), which will be quite nice. \n\nIt does post some issue when it come to legislation which is why, as I said, I believe the media is going to jump on it - anything that cannot be lawingly censored can easily be shown as `bad`. \n\nI think there are way to govern this if necessary - the whole point is, however, that hopefully, for us as a humanity - it won't be.",

It seems that most of the sites on ZeroNet are more \"proof-of-concept\" and thus aren't really that reliable in terms of actual usage.\n> That being said, perhaps your topic will inspire someone to do something a bit more permanent :)\n\nMh, this is just a \"message board\" while we would need a place for world issues as you say, a place for just fun discussion and hobby-talk, etc, proper inter-user interaction.\nWhile most things really are proof of concept here, I think we are starting to see which concepts work and not so far, so perhaps we can slowly start implementing more proper things! :)",

The identity it asked me to post on here is the same I used on ZeroMe and ZeroMail and everywhere else that required an identity (even an anonymous imageboard!) I don't know if I can even make a new one without deleting my entire ZeroNet profile and starting over. It seems I can only be one person on ZeroNet, which is counter to the way people participate on the public internet.\n\nYou can use multiple identities, all you have to do is enable the multiuser plugin and backup the master_seed of your current ID in the users.json file. Then you can login using it or create a new id, back it up too (I have a text file with just my usernames and the seeds for easy copy). To login you just have to go back to zero-hello and click logout>login, pasting the master_seed of whatever account you need. (and quickly pop to ZeroID so that it gives you your username)\n\n>Everything about the UI is hipster millennial garbage though.\nEh, I like it,  but to each their own. I much prefer it to something old and \"techy\" and \"dark\". It's modern and slick. That's about it. \n\n>It's potentially really cool.\nThat's really about it, isn't it?
