				"body": "In a true anarchist society self defense is duty, not right - it can't be else, as by refusing to defend yourself you are attacking directly any and all other members of the society and force them to defend themselves from you. Something more - if anarchists actually form a stable society they will have to have working set of mutual self defense rules. And self defense is unlimited - no distinction between physical, economical, humanitarian (self defense against attacks that use humanitarian technologies like religion, morale, ideology, etc.), etc. and bans on specific types as in state system based societies.\n\nThis means in anarchist society there can be no \"holding gun to the head\". Pull out your gun to use it as a threat and any member of the society is obligated to kill you on spot.",
