First it's CP, everybody says ok, then it's shocking material, then it's torrent, and finally it just talk. \n> If we need to deal with CP, there are ways without blocking totally it. A system with democratic reviews of sites, or a list system like adblock, which can be disabled (in case the content is not CP, but something else). \n> I repeat, the problem with CP is not the network which contain it, but the psychopaths in real life doing such things. Those are the target we need to aim, not the networks. You have lots of CP in the clear anyway. Even IRL (comet Pizza).\n\nAgreed...;)",
