But how to correct to post data to ZeroTalk? I, look, data are duplicated both in JSON, and in SQLite. Whether it means that data income from network in JSON, and SQLite is their cache for acceleration of local work? So I should save the new post information both in JSON, and in SQLite? Whether there is some more beauty solution?",
