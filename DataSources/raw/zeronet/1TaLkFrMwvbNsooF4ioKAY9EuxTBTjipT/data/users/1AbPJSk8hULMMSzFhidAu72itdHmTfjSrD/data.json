But I really recommend you look at PC Engines https://www.amazon.de/PC-Engines-APU2C4-Komplett-Alu-Geh%C3%A4use/dp/B01GEIEI7M/ with a larger mSATA SSD than the 16 GB that kit ships with instead of a Raspie.",

Interestingly in the last DNS DDoS attack, the dark web, including ZeroNet was the only internet still up for meâ€¦\n\nHigher availability due to decentralization is definitely a major plus. Projects like cjdns and ZeroNet, Tahoe LAFS do really look like they will be around for a long while.",
