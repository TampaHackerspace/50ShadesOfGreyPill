So I enable \"Always enable TOR\", so does that mean I am now anonymous? If so then why allow external links within post?\nFor example there's a link in this post:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:9901_1KbV1e1u6P6AsY8XNBydgtbtN8iSB5WMyG/Nigel+Farage+s+aide+and+his+dark+web+drug+money+laundering+scam\n\nOne could easily forge an exploit to someone unsuspecting and allow compromise.\n\nSo basically I'm not convinced as of yet.",
