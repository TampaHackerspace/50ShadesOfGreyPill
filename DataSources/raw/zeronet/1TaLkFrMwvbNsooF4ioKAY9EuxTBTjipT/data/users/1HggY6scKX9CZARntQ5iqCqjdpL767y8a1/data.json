It's primarily designed with one very specific use in mind: Darknets.\n\nThe intended use was to form a web of client nodes with people that you know in person, to communicate within that network rather than relying on a social networking site. It's web-of-trust played straight, although it also supports third party routing like ZeroNet does. People who like the program will often exchange keys with strangers to form broader networks though, which somewhat defeats the purpose. I haven't used it in awhile, but I find that it works very well for P2P file sharing. I've not seen any serious complaints about the security of it though. Just your stereotypical stuff about how the NSA has compromised it and so forth, but nothing to back it up.",
