(realistic) why the f..k we give a piece of s..t about that at all?\n\nso lets examine 'fairy tales':\n\nhttps://dzone.com/articles/cube-drone-comic-js-community-persistence-and-vers\n\nIts in essence a fairy tale of ROI and money, which goes something like this:\n\n\"We had so much 'I' over several generations that we will never reach 'R', that is unless all expected 'R' is not going to be shown in 'M' because 'M' will cease to exist (or we bankrupt over expectation of 'R').\"\n\nand\n\n\"When we invented M, we thought it is going to have social function and help us exchange value of our contribution, only to realize it became a tool for ruling over our lives by declaring that M===success (and several other similar fairy tales), \nYet we never ceased to believe in it (M), and continue to use it (M) even when it become a crypto soup (read: perceived freedom from establishment by introducing equivalent establishment or ERG, which is only fair until we find that holy grail called 'perpetual source of energy' - may god (or whatever improvable deistic supramundane intelligence) bless us  to find that :) )\"\n\nIn the first part we can easily waste couple more of generations by declaring that we need to reach that magical 'R'. Or perhaps we can ignore the facts, and continue in CoffeScript, Dart, TypeScript and ES6 whatever s**t you believe it is 'solving the problem' of 'js'.\n\nOn the second part I have no comment, except that humanity may eventually get to the idea that happiness=success (and define happiness not in relation to magical 'M') and/or stop using improvable deistic supramundane intelligences to collect M for R and we all go kill ourselves in finding PSoE (so that we have endless supply of crypto keys). \n\nNo offense, All the best from Zozon",

For two reasons:\n\n1. Internet is much more than web only (and there is long living misconception that web=internet, which of course it isn't, whereby web is very likely most used\\*) - even that (most used) would be questionable if you look from some perspective - e.g. data transfer - web would be much lower on the scale of how much data has been transferred.\n\n2. Zero net would not most likely replace normal web but something like ZeroNet will eventually (together with IPFS) become a new breed of internet services - based on hashes. I can envision from here a new uri schemes and fitting this new concept in the existing ones (as much as this would be heretical view of current ZeroNet user desires) - (and we will see reinventing the wheel in re-creating all services that have been created to clearnet to serve this new breed of 'hashed' services - this trend can already be spotted with existing development).\n\nI find both ZeroNet and IPFS (and to some degree Freenet) having same essential concept but in spite that Freenet is around for a decade or so, humanity still did not figure that this approach deserves proper internet protocol (and perhaps supra (or integration) concept). I find that this realization will eventually happen in the time - usually such things happen when someone gets so bored doing the same thing again and again on information inter-exchange so one develops some convenient approach that people would eventually like.\n\nI am even fond of the idea that this 'protocol' goes as down as extension of IP protocol (skipping OSI layer down) or up OSI layer becoming something like 'super-web'?!? (it shall then encompass normal http too to be complete like dynamic sites encompass static content). Current implementation of ZeroNet is struggling to fit into existing http - it lacks services that the 'browser' recognizes as native. So 'browser' will also need to change.\n\nWe will need this new breed of services very soon - as soon as IoT kicks in on larger scale - questions will be asked on how to automate tedious configuration and integration tasks, and of course you cannot setup web server for every small item that knows to communicate on the internet. (much like when DHCP appeared - yes in the dawn of internet IP addresses have been setup manually - today very few people setup IP numbers manually, most people on the internet actually never learned that there is some thing called IP number :) )\n\nZeroNet implementation currently uses browser as front end (presentation only) and instead of going directly down on dns, and ip sockets, and http protocol actually it 'outsources' exchange processing down to web server and p2p as execution/transport layer - good for experimenting but too complicated to non-technological user. In essence ZeroNet looks like that becomes in OSI layer one step up but it actually fits in between presentation and transportation layers. Browser will NEED to change to accommodate this problem and only way becomes to develop the protocol.\n\nSo, how you will feel if I tell you following:\n\nI would like to have one server with plugins that cover freenet, zeronet, ipfs and perhaps dozen of other 'like' services in ONE functional system? I would like to choose which plugins to activate and how they shall be configured and have a several programming languages supporting the concept ...
