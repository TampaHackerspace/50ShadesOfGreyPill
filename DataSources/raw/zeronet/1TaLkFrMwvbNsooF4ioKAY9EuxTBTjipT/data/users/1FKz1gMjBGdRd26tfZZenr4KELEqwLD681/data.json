I welcome our chinese comrads :)\n\n> [dun](#comment_4_14nCEDo97Cx4VpSHwPytWvacPo29Y7FAbk): Eh, I really just want an alternative to ZeroTalk that lots of ZeroNet people use, but lets you filter based on the content - like a traditional chan board, or like Reddit's setup with subreddits. It seems the Language is what defines the different boards here, so I am wishing I didn't have to sift through Chinese comments to find content I can understand. It's not personal. :-D\n\nAh I see :P That makes sense, \"我懂你的话和我喜欢你的想法啊。\" ~Anon",
