It has a double hop feature that allows you to encrypt your machine traffic and website traffic and make it seem like they're coming from two different places entirely. If you go on stack social, be on the look out for that VPN going on sale, you can usually grab up a lifetime sub for like, 70 dollars easy. That's opposed to the hundreds you'd usually get going to Windscribe directly as a continuous payment.\n\nGot the windscribe lifetime recently. pretty good so far",
