			"body": "Hi, I want to test the namecoin system, but I don't have namecoins. I had zetacoins but I lost the wallet.\nA few months ago I downloaded the namecoin blockchain, but I thought the project was discontinued. I thought it was hard to implement if you needed to download a 20GB blockchain in order to navigate.\n\nBut I found out that Opennic somehow resolves .bit domains, and Zero uses .bit domains too.\n\nSo I kindly ask for a Namecoin to test it. My account is NBD5KqxDXYAwCtZe3CsVmJYWvKZfozPuuG\nI'm still 66 weeks behind in this computer, but anyways I would appreciate a donation.",
