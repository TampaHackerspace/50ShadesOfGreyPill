Then you can login using it or create a new id, back it up too (I have a text file with just my usernames and the seeds for easy copy). To login you just have to go back to zero-hello and click logout>login, pasting the master_seed of whatever account you need. (and quickly pop to ZeroID so that it gives you your username)\n> \n> Eh, I like it,  but to each their own. I much prefer it to something old and \"techy\" and \"dark\". It's modern and slick. That's about it. \n> \n> That's really about it, isn't it? We just have to see where it goes, I suppose.\n\nI think it should be made easier though... So you can just select which IDs you want to use rather than having to enter a seed. But a bigger priority imo (as mentioned in previous post) is truly decentralized idents.",

To be fair, thats probably more to do with ZeroID rather than ZeroNet itself.",

Id like it so you can select multiple identities on the fly without having to move files about, would be much more convenient! That would work at least, so better than nothing!",

Wish these would take off more, its much more in keeping with the ZeroNet philosophy. Getting there bit by bit, OneName looks promising too.\n\nAlthough hopefully we will soon see providers on ZeroNet that will have personalized IDs (names) which work on all ZeroNet sites such as ZeroTalk.",
