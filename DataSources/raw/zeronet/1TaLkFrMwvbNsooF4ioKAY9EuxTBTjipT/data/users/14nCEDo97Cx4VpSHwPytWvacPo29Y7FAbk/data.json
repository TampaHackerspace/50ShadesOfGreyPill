I want to leave Reddit and find a replacement community, and I see a lot of potential in ZeroNet - but I don't like that discussion is all in one place, so you get Nazis, Racists, and Pedos all in the same place as Mac vs Linux and discussions about integrating ZeroNet and Electron, etc.\n\nIs there a zite that has a decent community, for tech and other interesting discussions? I have seen the 0chan and the Reddit clone, but I want to avoid pr0n and the Reddit clone doesn't seem to have users (and I don't want to have to have a separate login to use it, part of why I am here).",

You can't post something without associating it to a public key. I'm at a loss for how you'd do this without it. There's no 'true' anonymity on ZN. Just pseudo-anonymity. And yeah, the site is very new. Not really anything posted but I personally visit there often, so if something pops up I'll likely contribute. if you were looking for something active, you're shit outta luck.
