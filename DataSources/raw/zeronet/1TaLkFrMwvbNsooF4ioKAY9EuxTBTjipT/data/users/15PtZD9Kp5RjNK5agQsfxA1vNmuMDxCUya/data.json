Someone will find a proper way.2) Lets forget blockchain, start thinking raw from here, from ZeroNet. How would you do some simple points which are used to for example upvote. Start from 0.3) But look :) This \"coins\" have no any value. Its just points you get, I agree around decentralized authentication and how easy is to get this coins, this all we could think about right? Anyway what would stop to have central authority to give ZeroID?4) Other crypto outside ZeroNet can be traded easy :) ZeroNet internally created coin or whatever it would be would give much more control on shit market and bullshit\n\nYeah to be honest, I'm still unsure about ZeroID and how it's decentralised when in order for a .bit address itself to be registered, it has to be purchased by a central party.",
