Anarchism means no rulers, and communism wants a society where everything is shared, now it is obvious that not all humans want this, thus it has to be enforced. Oh hi, ruler!\n\nAnarcho-capitalism makes perfect sense. It's where one is free - free to make voluntary contracts. That means you may be a wage-slave, but it's your choice. Remember that there would be no copyright laws, thus corporations wouldn't grow as big as they are today.\n\nAlso, just a reminder that your anarcho-communist society can exist nicely inside an anarcho-capitalist world. However, an anarcho-capitalist society cannot exist nicely inside an anarcho-communist world.

How can you be anarchiust and capitalist if the definition of anarchy is anti-capitalist.  To be a capitalist you have to be in a heirachy of power.  Thats what capital is. By definition (this isnt my definition, look it up - adam smith agrees with me! )\n\ndon't know about your invented definition, but it literally means one without ruler. In an anarcho-capitalist society it would be just that - one without ruler. What you're saying about Adam Smith is just BS. Give me an actual quote, because I have never heard that in my life. Capital is a good or service that will give the owner of the capital revenue. That's the definition. Where does the hierarchy come into the picture?",

A free market allows you to get rich and buy guns and enforce copyright with or without a state.   Which is pretty much what copyright law has become today.  And TTIP is corporations making their own states!   Libertarians who get rich will become corporations.  So how will it help change anything.  Capitalism leads to inequality, and there is no capitalism without a state, state is just a word, but in the end it means people who have all the money and guns.  That can be a single libertarian.\n\nStupid people do stupid shit. Wage slavery is NEVER forced on people. If it's forced it's actual slavery. It's not a good situation, but it's their choice. They choose to sign the contract and they can terminate the contract at any time they please. It's a voulentry contract. They stay in it because it's benefitial for them. Just because they chose to live beyond their means doesn't mean they are actual slaves. They are idiots. But that's allowed.",

In a boxing match, you can't blame one boxer to hit the other in the face: it's the rule. However, there are other sport to practice, and even fighting sport less violent (wrestling, jiu jitsu).

Well they can rule this world, but not force me to like them, or sharing their view of society.\n\nStill not answering my questions. News flash. There are greedy people on this planet. Anarcho-capitalists biggest issues is to cope with agression. You cannot even cope with a person with ambition. Talk about a broken philosophy.\n\nAlso, no. Linus couldn't have been a billionair. I've been using linux exclusiveley since the nineties and was a linux evangelist for a decade. The only reason why Linux is so tremendously popular is because it was licenced under GPL. If he had been greedy it wouldn't have been a success. So I don't acknowledge that. As for Cohen, I wouldn't know, but I wouldn't automatically assume that to be true for him either.",

(And since people here cannot differentiate between my opinion and the an-cap philosophy, I will emphasise that this is my opinion.) The problem with earth today is that there are 7 billion people - and growing. This is not sustainable, no matter what you will happen to believe. Global warming is a problem because we are 7 billion people. Inequality is a problem because we are 7 billion people. Private jets are a problem because we are 7 billion people. Deforestation is a problem because we are 7 billion people.\n\nIf we were 1 million people non of this would be a problem. We have to make the best of the situation. We cannot force 7 billion people to behave in the altruistic good. That cannot be achieved without total tyranny. Communists will make exactly the same decisions as capitalists. Ultimately, a communist will chop down the forest if he believes it increases his likelihood of his and his offsprings long term survival.",

Even though they can still act as anarchists (and also many do do this).   Its not selfish to want to not die or go to prison.  Its hard! Anarchists dont need capitalists, its just that capitalists fight anarchists who want to try living without them because they demand everywhere on earth is private property.  And it is.  Every square inch of it is claimed by a capitalist somewhere backed by men with a lot of power and guns.  Even the trenches in the ocean.  Its the capitalists that are selfish.   I mean YES of course i could probably live in the gobi desert as an an com as long as I avoid the state, but yeh, I DONT WANT TO.  I want to live near water and resources.  There are no places where an coms can live , legally (according to capitalist law) , that have these without having to fight oppressive stae and corporate forces. .  And many do fight. Some are serving long time in prison for it right now.    By your own logic you have manegaed to say anarchists are selfish if they try AND  selfish if they dont!  Youi can't have it both ways!\n\nIt's beyond my comprehension why I keep debating an-cap with someone who consistently assume I'm a crony-capitalist. If you knew what an-cap was, this whole paragraph would not make any sense.\n\nAnd yes. There exist places were such things exist. There are people doing it. There are people living these lives. Just do some research. Many eco-villages are, for instance, similar to an-com in their very nature.\n\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_276_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): Not one of these is true.  Of the 7 billion people, most (around 70%) are extremnely poor and consume and polute  way way way less than fat rich people in the top 30%.  They have very little land, food, energy source or water, dont drive cars,  don't fly and consume little meat.  All the problems you listed are because the top of the capitalist pyramid produces and consumes to excess.   eg, deforestation in Brazil occurs to produce cattle farms to make Big Macs.  Only a fraction of the worlds population has ever eaten at mcdonalds.    Increased population growth WILL of course be a problem on a finite planet.  But as it stands, there is more than enough to go around.   We just don't want to share it.  And raising the standard of living for people reduces population growth.    As has been shown in almost every wealthy country in the world (exceptions being those that don't allow contraception or are extremely oppressive to women)\n\nThat's exactly my point. Private jets isn't a problem in and of it self. It's a problem when many people wants that lifestyle. And just like you said in the previous paragraph, the earth can't take 7 billion people, because I DONT WANT TO live like the poorest 1 billion. The earth can take 7 billion people if everybody has the standard of living that the bottom 1 billion has. But I want to live with the standard of living that I have now. If everybody wants my standard of living, we can't have 7 billion people. It's as simple as that.",

Because with a true free market we will have good products, that will last longer and be much cheaper. I believe almost everyone will be provided for, and the consumerism we see today will fade away. Eventually people will have everything they need. People have for instance almost stopped purchasing new computers because they last so long and most people don't generally need more computing power. Only a few groups of people need state of the art. When people no longer have to buy stuff, they can work less and spend more time with their family.

That is something that cannot exist without protection of the state violence. A free market (REAL capitalism) is not about stealing. Profit and stealing are two completely different things, and I don't know why you confuse them. Nothing has han absolute value. All values are relative. If you think that a house is worth $10 and the seller think it is worth $5, then the seller didn't steal $5 from you just because you paid $10. You VALUED the house to $10. Both parties are happy.

That's an other flaw of capitalism, in adition of enormous wealth gap between individuals and hierarchy. At one point, powerful businesses don't do what's best even for the whole market, or for the well being of humanity, but what's best only for them.\n\nNo, that is a preposterous claim. If you really believe what you are saying there, then it mwans all capitalists in the world are cooperating on suppressing technology. That is clearly not the case. This tells me you don't understand the free market at all. Thorium is in fact the best example I can think of. If someone can make it work, then they will corner the whole energy market. They will literally rule the energy of the earth for a number of years. That's such a tremendous opportunity that any capitalist would take it, even if it meant braking allegiances.  Claiming it's a global super conspiracy is just to easy.

They are state capitalists, or slavers, depending on the fact that you are outside or inside the gulag.\n\nExactly my point. They are not the same. They fly under the communist banner, so the comparison is fair.\n\n> What he tries to tell you is when you start to organize society with hierarchy (owners of the means of production, workers), money, delegation of power, then it's too late. Profit calls for more profit, and nothing will stop it. \n\nThat's might be true, but that's not a bad thing in my opinion. In a true free market the profit margins would be squeezed down to almost zero because of competition in the market. So the products you would buy would be produced almost as efficiently as possible. Because if there is room for doing something better and cheaper, in a free market somebody would.\n\n> You create a game, capitalism, and define the rules. Then everybody will act according to these rules, but they will always play the most agressively possible according to these rules, and sometimes (even often), they won't even respect the rules and go beyond them. That's why i believe free market will never be possible, since there will always be super rich sociopath who will do whatever they can, publicly or not,  to prevent this free market to ever happen. \n\nThat's funny. That's exactly the same reason why I believe communism wouldn't work. There will always be sociopaths who would justify that they could break the rules or that they and their friends should be more equal than others, etc. Someone would would claim their \"fair share\" of the production and then sell it for profits, trade it for goods, what ever.\n\n> However, if you completely change the game, and abolish the main rules (hierarchy, money, private property of the means of production), then there is no possibility of cheating anymore. Maybe there will  be other cheats possible, but we aren't here there.\n\nTo us it's a meaningless concept of \"cheating\". So long as everybody plays by the rule that nobody should be forced to do something against their will, then you cannot cheat either. I guess you have the same rule, otherwise it wouldn't be anarchist at all. Hence, we can co-exist. You cannot stop us from making a profit. And we will beat your game because we give people what they want, not what you determine they should have.\n\n> [planespherev3](#comment_108_1HYB4Pe6irbQgDbeKm1zeFD7M8pdbksFeS): Charity exist still capitalism exist, and it doesn't really work. It's like bandages to heal a fatal wound. What we need is a system where we don't need charity. Were we don't need to take on some to give to others. \n\nThat wasn't the point. He comes with stupid strawmen arguments all the time. In the other thread he asked me why I was on zeronet. This was sort of a reference to that.\n\n> So you try to restore balance between what you have and what other have. Why not having a system were there is no balance to restore, because everything is even (at least regarding living condition, because i'm not against someone being a natural leader or someone respected  because he's competent). \n> Not everything is to be free, just the means of production to be shared. Then if you want to have your own watch or your own computer, nobody will take it from you. It's the distinction between private property and personal property. Personal property (E.G a watch, clothes, a car...), cannot be used to produce other stuff, so you can keep them.\n\nBecause communism breeds laziness. You want everybody to share everything. You even say it in this very paragraph. Share the means of production. That creates an imbalance, where people who don't contribute their fair share gets rewarded. People will see that some people are slacking but get the same thing. They determine that they shouldn't be working their ass of either. So, it's a negative spiral.\n\nMean while the free market breeds production. We are rewarded, and you might not approve of it, but generally people are motivated by a reward. People produce awesome shit, and get an awesome reward. People want the reward, but how to get it? Hard work! Obviously some people become envious, so they steal, because they feel that they are entitled to something. Because of scarcity the price is to high, they cannot afford it and they steal it. (That's why our solution to poverty is more free market, because that will lower the price of everything)\n\nAnyway, what you say doesn't make any sense. It's a contradiction. First you say that there wouldn't be envious people because everybody would have what they wanted. Then you say the means of production is shared. I guess that implies that you wouldn't just get free shit. You would have to use the means of production and produce the item, e.g. work. Well. What if people don't want to work but still want the product? They will steal! You face exactly the same problem as we do.",

(I genuinely think most capitalists would think you are wrong about it too)  The reason I use the internet is in hope to contribute to a better society for all.   As is the case with all the things I purchase and live with.  But its a straw man argument anyway.  My goal in life is perfect anarchy.  I can't create that single handedly. That doesnt mean I just wither and die instead of fighting and using the tools I have access too.   Even if they are products of capitalism.   I am a fish in a tank, I can't escape the toxic water and clean it from the outside.  And the reason I asked  why you use zeronet was because you specifically pointed out that capitalists make better innovators than open source ones.   That is not a straw man line.   Its a straight up question because unlike almost any other software, there are more capitalist social network  services than anything else.  Some belong to the largest corporations in the world.  And none of them are decentralised.  I think decentralisation of the web and blockchain tech is one of the most game changing innovations of the last decade.   And not one major software company came up with it, in fact they just didnt want it.   They spend more time fighting it than embracing it.  As they have with torrent software.  Thats the problem with profit.  It hinders innovation.   If microsoft had of invented bitcoin, it would never be allowed to exist.\n\nJust because I said the free market are better innovators, doesn't mean that they will have all the inventions, duh. And I don't understand where you've got it from that I don't want open source stuff like GNU/Linux and zeronet. I love these projects. I've never said that I don't want to use something that does not come from the market. The point I'm trying to make all along (\"try\". Obviously I fail) is that we have so much in common. We want freedom from oppression. It's just that I also believe that we cannot have freedom without the free market, because then it wouldn't be freedom at all.\n\nMy Major point is here: *If we have anarchy we have the right to engage in voluntary contracts. If I cannot conduct business with somebody else, then it is because it is enforced by someone. Hence, I would have a ruler, and there would by definition be no anarchy.\n\nWe literally want the same thing, but you are more focused on the social aspect and we are focused on business aspect.\n\n> [planespherev3](#comment_118_1HYB4Pe6irbQgDbeKm1zeFD7M8pdbksFeS): Would you please shut up and read the wikipedia page about the THTR-300?

Thorium is less profitable than oil/gas because oil and gas is in limited supply. \n\nNo. Absolutely not. I've explained it already that in a true free market there would be no conspiracy to undermine the market. The reason is that someone would realize that if they broke the bond (between the co-conspirators) they would be richer than if they kept the bond. In fact, it's a prisoners dilemma with a well known strategy - you should defect.\n\nAlso it's not more profitable because it's limited supply. That doesn't make any sense. By the same logic Thorium energy would be almost free of charge because it's so abundant and all sold energy would be profit since there is practically no cost of mining thorium. It's more profitable because\n1) it is what people want. People can't fuel their car with thorium - yet. \n2) The process of converting petrochemicals to energy is much simpler because it relies on electromagnetism which is orders of magnitude simpler than dealing with, and taming, the electroweak iteration.\n\n> And is exactly why profit and capitalism can't ever solve the worlds problems. \nI agree that the free market may not work as well for solving climate problems. On the other hand - I don't believe it can be solved. Because as I've already mentioned somewhere. You cannot force 7 billion people to comply without total tyranny.\n\n> The reason you arent using Microsoft or google decentralised web platform right now isnt because its not a great invention, its because its not profitable.  They can't control the market, access or supply of data.   Same goes for so much technology when left to capitalism. The motivations of profit conflict with the motivations of what people actually want.  Advertising is needed to train us to want what they are selling, and to give up on our imaginations and innate desires, to tell us they are fantasies and that only they have the solutions you can purchase for just 10 dollars eaches. \n\nThe beautiful thing about anarchy (with free market) is that people like you and other hacker spaces would create a search-engine that was just as good as google, but on that didn't have advertisement. So people could chose from which service they wanted. The reason why people cannot do it today is because google be some sort of magic \"owns\" the algorithm. It's absurd. Google wouldn't be in the position it has today in a free market - that is what you people don't understand.\n\n> Warlock you should read DrSeuss's The Sneeches if you havnt already.

What's more, it is suggested (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_resolution_organization) that there would be many of such firm competing with each other in a free market. Then what happen if some don't like one organization and doesn't respect it's mediation or personal protection? If more and more were to place their trust in one dispute resolution organization, and others in an other one? \n\nI never said it was perfect, but an-cap is the closest thing to freedom that I can think of. Some contracts will be voided and you will take a loss, for sure. That is also the case today, and that will also be the case for an-com. Signing a contract is inherently risky, but you can gain great benefits and rewards. \n\nYou don't have to be convinced. I believe it will work. If you don't believe it then that's fine. David Friedman, how thought out something similar, is not even 100% sure it will work - but he said he believed it would. Btw, the old stock-exchanges were similar to DROs. If a company didn't fulfil their obligation, they were kicked out of the stock exchange. It has been tested small scale and it worked.\n\n> What if all the people behind one DRO decide that the other ones are not legitimate anymore? What happen then? Civil war. \n\nOne DRO can't decide the other ones are not legitimate. The market makes that judgement. And it's not a given that it will be civil war. That's your assumption.\n\nWith that said, we ultimately have to find a way to deal with violence as well. Even though we have the non-aggression principle, some will not follow it. The same is true for an-com. You seem to be making the assumption that if just everybody could realize what you have realized, then there would be peace on earth. Similarly you assume that in every other case than an-com, there will be war, killing and crime.\n\n\n> One other issue is that even if DRO work, it could end like being some state. So instead of having a public state, you'll have one, or many, private states. Isn't that even worse?\n\nThat depends on what you define to be a \"state\". David Freidman suggested something similar to DROs, that one can have laws in the same manner as one has \"insurance\" policies today. If you sign a contract with this company, they will protect you but only if you follow their laws. If you do not follow their laws, you are not protected. Then in principle you can choose what laws you want to follow depending on what company you choose. Disputes between people will then be settled between the different companies.\n\nThe reason why I entered the discussion in the first place was to see if I could find some common ground. Because ultimately, if states can be overcome then we have to find a way to co-exist. There simply isn't any other way.

Or are you saying nobody need oil now aswell.  But just to be clear:  The price of oil has been going up over the last decades.  This is because of its scarcity and because it is in demand.  Which of these were you denying causes the price rise?\n\nNo. We were talking about how a global conspiracy do not invest in Thorium energy because the profit is higher in oil/gass energy where you claimed that oil/gass is more profitable because of limited supply. Later you reinforced the nonsensiacal claim by adding that everybody wants electricity, but lets assume you didn't say that.\n\nAt the current oil price production is barley break even, and many oilfields even operate at a loss. This is true for oil in Europe, Russia and North America. Middle East is still special because they still have oil flowing naturally out of the ground. They have different problems though, where kings and princes claim the profits and some countries are \"bribing\" the public to compliance. This is extremly expensive.\n\nSo,\nPoint 1) You claim they only push oil because there is more profit than in Thorium. Earlier you have also claimed that profit is the only motive. If this was the case, then a significant fraction of the production in North America and Europe should be shut down for the time being because they operate at a loss.\n\nPoint 2) Oil (excluding the Middle East) is extremly complex to produce because either you have to operate wells at deep water with platforms above several hundred meters of water and then drill wells several kilometers through rocks and mountains. For North America you have to fracture rock formation to get the oil, or you have to separate tar from sand, and then produce oil from the tar which can then be refined to petroleum. The energy return of investment is at an all time low.\n\nCompare this with Thorium, and the energy is readily available. The cost of producing Thorium could easily be approximatley free because of its abundance. In other words, you could basically get \"free energy\" with Thorium, given that all your claims are true. In other words, those \"nasty\" capitalists could take something that was free (Thorium), bombard it with neutrons to create energy through a nuclear chain reaction. This energy is sold for a profit. To me this is clearly a much more profitable strategy.\n\nSo basically, if Thorium is as good as you claim, then the energy return of investment should be much higher for Thorium because of its abundance. If all your claims are true, then this is much more profitable (sell energy where the energy carrier is almost free). It is this argument I'm saying doesn't make any sense. Other than that I say that price is determined by both supply AND demand, which is regarded as a universal axiom in economics. And once again you are twisting my words.\n\n\nWith all that said, oil is a special comodity because the supply is not determined by market forces but by an oil cartel called OPEC. You claim that OPEC is also in control of the nuclear energy market in a global conspiracy. I do not believe so.",

Of course the price of oil is profitable when there is limited supply compared to demand.  Like gold.  (hence the term black gold)\n\nThat's the point. \"Compared to demand\" is a phrase you added after your initial statement. But still it's not necessarily true. You still have the profit maximisation. Selling a huge quantity of something with a small profit for each transaction gives you the same profit as selling a small quantity with a huge profit for each transaction.\n\nThis got way out of track, so I'll go back to square one to try and sort out the confusion. My whole point has been that this statement here is a very simplistic view, and wrong:\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_280_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): And, warlock, this is a fine  example of how capitalism stifles innovation to protect profits of those with powerful interests (oil and gas).  Thorium is less profitable than oil/gas because oil and gas is in limited supply.  Like gold and bitcoin.  The desire for profit means oil will always be heavily invested in.   The goal of oil industry isnt to find or sell more oil, but to make sure no one else does.   The last barrel of oil will be as valuable as today's 10,000 barrels.  To profitteers thats all that matters.  Its usefulness is secondary to limiting supply.  \n\nAdding some random text here to separate these two quotes of you.\n\n> You dont think everyone wants electricity?  ( By everyone I mean 99.999% of the worlds population - you seem to be  inferring some imaginary marginal group prefers not to have electricity and thus my argument is invalid because I said everyone  - that is obtuse and pedantic, and weakens your position further) \n\nOf course. You gave the impression that people didn't want oil/gass. I must have misunderstood the following statement. For that I apologize.\n\n> [thisweb11](#comment_292_1D9w8AJTfqmn26iT2kF81B8HxXFfycXuXM): 1)  Everyone in the world wants electricity, who said anything about fueling cars?\n\nSkip some of the paragraphs, and jump to this on:\n\n> I never said there was  a conspiracy.  They don't need one.  The laws of capitalism decide oil will be used because its more profitable than all other sources of energy.  And being limited in supply and high in demand it continues to make it so.  (there are no commercial aeroplanes that can run without oil - they dont exist, and as far as I know nobody is attempting to design one)\n\nYes. This is a misunderstanding from me. I realized it after rereading one of your comments. I apologize. ",

The reason is simple. The first entrepreneur who can make Thorium energy work will corner the energy market. In other words, those who makes Thorium work can make the oil and gas more or less go out of business. Hence, there is a tremendous interest in the free-market to get Thorium to work! Once the technology is there to make it profitable, Thorium will come.\n\nThe profit margin per kWh for petrochemical might be higher, but the quantity of kWh for Thorium will, in the long term, far outweigh the high profit margin of petrochemicals. Especially now with the electric vehicle \"revolution\". \n\nI guess this is what I have misunderstood where I though you were saying that capitalists didn't want to invest in Thorium because they wanted the limited supply of petrochemicals to increase profits.\n\nAlternatively, Thorium might never be profitable. Then we will not have Thorium in a free-market. In this scenario I don't think the world would be a better place if we stopped using petrochemicals in favour of Thorium, even for environmental purposes. That's my opinion, and I'm sure you will disagree. ;)",

Thats a pretty good incentive.  And you're deeply cynical to assume people (not just anarchists) don't care unless they get money.  Not everyone is a capitalist.  There are way more anticapitalists than there are anarchists.   There are socialists and other nations in the world who are happy to pay  more taxes for energy investment to prevent the destruction of the planet.  Not least because so many of them have children who will suffer its worse effects.  People are waking up.  Its a shame you cant see the benefits outside a free market which caused it in the first place.\n\nObviously the world is not very capitalistic at all. We are seeing stronger divisions now than before. After the financial crisis many people have come to hate capitalism. Despite that people are very anti-capitalistic and everybody want the global warming to be fixed, very few want to live by example. Very few wants a reduced standard of living so that we can work toward that goal.\n\nIn fact I tried for almost 10 years to live by example. I never bought new things. We (Me and my wife) bought our things from fleemarkets. We took the bus/train when we could. We still don't own a car. We never upgraded our technological items, unless we absolutley had to. I wore jeans and hoodies with holes in them. We had around 16-20 deg C in our living room depending on season. I showered rarley and with cold water. etc. etc. etc. I almost evangelized that the consumer-mentality people had would destroy the planet. Yet not a single person I met cared. They thought what I did was noble, but that it wasn't for them. Not ONE thought that maybe they too should take action. After 10 years I came to the conclusion that people just don't care. So I gave it up. Raised my standard of living, and haven't regretted it one day.\n\n(And no, being against the consumer mentality is not in opposition to An-Cap. If you believe so, you haven't understood An-Cap one bit.)\n\n> \n> Only if they make profit (else they would drop the capitalist part) \n> \nOf course not. Not all An-Caps want a profit. An-Caps want to be free. Some An-Caps will appear to be An-Com because they create things for free just because they want the technology to exist. Still they want the goods and service that money provide. An-Caps mean you want a free and unregulated market. \n\nBesides, we are not working for an An-Com world. We create service that will move the world toward an An-Cap world. In the process we will probably exploit \"An-Com\" technology too, like bitcoin and zeronet, who one can argue are An-Com in nature.\n\n> No because you need to do things for your own survival that are not profitable and not capitalist.  This is true for everyone.  And the most important things will make the least profit (like fixing man made climate change and sharing resources)\n\nDidin't understand this.",

Allowing literal Nazis to air their evil on your general-purpose discussion board is feeding them, certainly far more so than not allowing such would be. It's letting their views spread and perpetuate, it's letting them gain momentum, and all the while it's alienating good people who just aren't safe in a community with no practical way to escape fascist contributors.\n\nI don't believe in censoring any opinions, no matter how much one must dislike it. Because ultimately you're not stopping their opinion. You're masquerading it. Just because you can't read it doesn't mean they don't have it. If they are undermined for a prolonged time they will eventually surface and explode in rage.\n\nJust look to Europe. It is no longer allowed to criticize muslims. Their opinion is censored everywhere. There is no airwave where people can express their opinion on muslims. There is no newspaper where one can express their opinion of muslims. The public sector and the media overall is an echo chamber. These people have no contact with the common man. These people don't even realize that people dislike the immigration policies.

Genocide is objectively evil, and anyone claiming otherwise is objectively wrong.\n\nJust to be clear. The act of genocide is not an opinion. Advocating genocide is, per definition, a legitimate opinion. However, it's also outrageous. And yes, I agree that it is objectively wrong and objectively evil. I understand you 100%.\n\nHowever, the reason I'm critical is this. Just like you're on a mission to \"remove\" hatred, I'm on a mission to support freedom of speech, no matter what the opinions might be. That's one of the reasons why I'm running this zeronet node. The whole emergence of \"fake news\" motivates me even more, since governments are seriously discussing to remove \"fake news\" from existence. (E.g. implementing ministry of truth).\n\nI don't know where you are from, but in Europe people have a growing frustration with the established parties, most of which agree on increasing imigration of people from countries we are at (proxy) war with. This has led to the uprising of \"extremist\" parties. And at least two-three countries have tried to silence them using the slippery-slope of anti-semetism. Their logic is that in the 1930 and 1940 people expressed their hatred of jews which lead to genocide. Since people are now expressing hatred of muslims, this too will lead to genocide. This is obviously a logical fallacy.\n\nSome people in these \"extremist\" parties are obviously way across the line, but most people are decent people. I can't recall any having argued for genocide of muslims. People simply want the immigration to stop. Now, Europe wouldn't be in this situation in the first place if people were actually allowed to state their opinion, but they aren't. Just arguing of a tightening in the policy will get them labelled as \"racist\", even though they are not. They will be bullied and assaulted physically and verbally. However, this is NOT considered hate-crime, so usually there is no consequence of assaulting these people. In fact, stating their opinion was the act of hate.\n\nThis is also occurring in the US. People have almost been murdered just for voting for Trump and the justification for the violence was that the person was a racist. This is insane.\n\nThis polarizing is, in my un-humble opinion, the direct result of people being censored. The discussions have to be made, or the problem will get exponentially worse. The more immigrants that come the more people will \"cross over\", and the more traction these extremists get.
