The successive blows of contending armies have all but broken the back of European Jewry and have reduced to tragically unbelievable poverty, starvation and disease about 6,000,000 souls, or half the Jewish population of the earth.\nOriginally Posted by Felix M. Warburg, New York Times, November 12th, 1919\n(half of the population - six millions remain)\n\nBut we can find even more occurrences of the six million Jews and Jewish Holocaust here\nhttp://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php",
