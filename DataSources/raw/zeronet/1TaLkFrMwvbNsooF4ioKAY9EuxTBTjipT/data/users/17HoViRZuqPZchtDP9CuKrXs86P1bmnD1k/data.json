				"body": "questions on comparing zeronet to tor hidden services....\nOn tor hidden services, to my understanding, you setup a webserver, and setup tor to point to webserver, on certain .onion address. this means that only one server is hosting, and despite being hidden, its a simple point of failure. Server goes down, hidden services down too. This also makes it more identifiable.\nNow, on zeronet after you invite someone to visit/or share your site, they become a peer and \"seed\" your site. \nI've enabled port forwarding, so im seeding, multiple sites, and in Stats i can see some ip's and such. \nIs it possible know what X ip is hosting? Like on bittorrent, if im downloading a torrent, i can see which ip's are downloading that same torrent, so how it is in zeronet?\n\nAwesome, project. Amazing coding",
