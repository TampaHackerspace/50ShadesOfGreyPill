If your country is in some TIPP partnership or whatever shit they're coming up with next, you can be Kim Dotcom-ed to the US. At least theoretically.\n> \n> I would suggest you to run a site with photos of flowers or trees.Much better risk/reward ratio.\n> \n> Careful people will simply not click on a collection links just because they're posted by some guy who claims he's reviewed them. Tor isn't as secure and anonymous as you think.\n> \n> You want to build a 90's Yahoo type of site (directory) whereas people have moved to Google type of service (search) to find content.  Most \"best of\" sites are outdated and the approach doesn't scale.\n\n\"Tor isn't as secure and anonymous as you think.\" - yeah, it's traffic is a red flag (easy to recognize to see if it's Tor traffic), and can be easily correlated with many things - not mentioning the compromised exit nodes.",

Majority of dump people just won't bother with installing things like that, which requires some effort, they just use facebook / twitter, therefore I think the chances of talking with intelligent people is much greater than using just the mainstream platforms.",
