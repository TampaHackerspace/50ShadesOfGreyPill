				"body": "Backstabbing Jew is real\nWe are learning from the school and in the mainstream media that  that 'backstabbing Jew' is a defamation myth against Jews.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth\nThe truth is that the Jews can never give up their bad habits.\nThey stab in the back not only others but each other also.\nJewish Israeli man, Shlomo Pinto was convicted of attempted murder for stabbing in the back another Jewish man, Uri Razkan whom he mistook for an Arab.\n“I’m working, and suddenly I feel four knife stabs in my back,” Razkan said at the time, adding that “I heard a shout, ‘you deserve it, you deserve it, Arab bastards!’ When I turn around I see an ultra-Orthodox man. I shouted to him, ‘I’m a Jew,’ but he tried to continue. I just ran away; otherwise I would have been killed.”\nhttp://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-convicted-of-stabbing-a-jew-he-mistook-for-an-arab/",
