(like an RPG character)\nThe Yesod (Connection) is Gods property. It signifies also the male sex organ on the Tree of Life from the Kabbalah.\nWhen the rabbi sucks the blood from the penis of the baby it has a symbolic meaning.\nIt makes connection to God for the spirit of the child through the rabbi.\nMetzitzah bâ€™peh is a holly sucking for Jews and essential for their religion.",
