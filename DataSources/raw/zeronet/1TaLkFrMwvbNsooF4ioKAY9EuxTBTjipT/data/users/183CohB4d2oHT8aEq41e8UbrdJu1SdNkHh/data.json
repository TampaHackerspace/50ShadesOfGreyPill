				"body": "Agreed, actually if you remember the internet anonymity project previous to this, Freenet, we should be so lucky that we only get flooded with cat pictures and trolls. We need something like Freenet's \"Web of Trust\", where upvoting / downvoting occurs reddit style but applies not only to a post, but percolates between users. For example if you upvote a post, people who've upvoted your posts will see that post go up, while if you downvote a post, people who've upvoted your posts will see that post go down. You're influenced by the upvotes and downvotes of people you've upvoted, but not that of people you've downvoted. This goes a fair way down the chain too.",
