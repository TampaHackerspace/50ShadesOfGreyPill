But you should be able to block individual users that are blatantly trolling. Freenet had a clever system where up-voting individual users would percolate through people that up-voted you, so those people would see the comments  of the the account that you up-vote as higher rating; the idea being that trolls that get down-voted essentially have their accounts drop off the system completely.",
