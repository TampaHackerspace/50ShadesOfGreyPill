				"body": "Ukrainian sources have reported that Israel imported more than 25 000 Gentile children from Ukraine for organ harvesting during two years(2008-2009). An Ukrainian man have fruitlessly searched for 15 children who had been adopted in Israel. The children had clearly been taken by Israeli medical centers, where they were used for ‘spare parts’.\nNone of the 25 000 adopted children have been seen ever. Supposedly they were used for ritual purpose or organ harvesting for very high profit.\nAccording to Jewish Law\n“A Gentile murderer who happens to be under Jewish jurisdiction must be executed whether the victim was Jewish or not. However, if the victim was Gentile and the murderer converts to Judaism, he is not punished.\"\n“A Jew who murders a Gentile is guilty only of a sin against the laws of Heaven, not punishable by a court. To cause indirectly the death of a Gentile is no sin at all.\" \nIf the child dies following the organ harvesting, the Jew have not caused directly his death so it is no sin at all.\nhttps://mx22.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/25000-ukrainian-children-organs-havested-in-israel/",
