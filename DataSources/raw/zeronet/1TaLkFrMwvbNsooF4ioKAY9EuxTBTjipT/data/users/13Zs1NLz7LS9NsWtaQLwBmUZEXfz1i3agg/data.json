I had an account before...\n\nDid you wait for a bit? I just moved from one machine to the other, taking users.json with me,  and while at first the page didn't show properly after waiting for the ZeroMe user registry to sync it did.\n\nHeh, [p2p](#comment_300_13Z7XxTa7JuFat3KzzMWu3onwM6biLuurJ)'s comment showed up while I was writing this. Didn't even have to reload the page, pretty slick.",

Reddit as tree style comments, not a flat list. And the comments are usually ordered by upvote/downvote ratio, which ZeroTalk doesn't seem to do either.\n\nThis seems more like a normal forum to me, it just looks a bit reddit like.",
