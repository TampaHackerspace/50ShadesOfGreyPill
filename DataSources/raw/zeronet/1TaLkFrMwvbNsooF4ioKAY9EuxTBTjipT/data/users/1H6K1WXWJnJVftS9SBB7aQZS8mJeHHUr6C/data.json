Moslems and Jews are not because they want to kill or enslave us all any way they can.\n> Who do you think the capitalist leaders are?\n> The same people own or control all the important business, institutions, media, and politicians, as well as all the money.\n> What better system are you referring to?\n> Capitalism is just the tails side of the shekel and communism is heads.

Unfortunately they absolutely do not. Never have. I wish it wasn't true but it is. Accordingly the weak cannot be permitted to influence state policy directly because they will be exploited and manipulated at every turn by those seeking to gain power for their own ends at the expense of the common good. Only a strong leader with a vested interest in the welfare of his people can make the right decision when faced with a decision that requires a strong character to make.\n\nJust for you to know, there wasn't any real communism in the modern history, except the last existing primitive tribes. What you refer as communism, which i guess is URSS, Cuba and North Korea, isn't communism, but state capitalism. They have money as a mean of exchange. They have political economy. Thus what is commonly refered as communist is, in fact, state capitalism. \n\nOnce this is understood, people will open they mind to a new mode of production.",

It will arise out of the refusal to accept that there is either: private property or currency.\n\n\nThe german tribes who fought the romans were communists (real ones not bolsheviks aka state capitalists). \n\nThey shares the land, the animals, the food, the tools. It's only around the 5-6 century that they began to use currency and private property. \n\nAlso during the middle age, which is presented by the mainstream system as dark age, many things were shared, like lands, tools etc...\n\nPrivate property doesn't exist in homo sapiens natural state. \n\nHomo sapiens lived from 160000 BC to 12000 BC without private property. \n\nI do no say that you shall not own your own computer or your own toothbrush, but the means of production (factories, lands, power stations), should be shared in a non monetary system.",

Regarding this 5%, the movement is almost what was wanted by the elite. In rare occasion, there are surprises, but anyway, Trump clearly represent the system in all it's aspects. Certainly he has some charism and a flavor which might appeal for many, but he'll only perpetrate the system. \nLike Robert Greene wrote in the 48 laws, in a political election, often the choice is between Charybdis and Scylla. \n\nIt's done like that since the beginning of the 20th century.",

All existing humans are a single race in biological taxonomic sense as they can have common children and have the same number of chromosomes.Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthal could be considered human sub-races. They are genetic evidences that an interbreeding between them occurred in the Middle-East 50 000 years ago.\n> \n> 100% Africans are 100% Homo sapiens with 0% Homo neanderthal blood.\n> non-Africans - Europeans, Asians, black people from India and black people from Papua are 1-4% Homo neanderthal and 96-99% Homo sapiens interbred.So genetically only this two human sub-races exists - with or without Neanderthal blood. All others are just sub-sub-races.\n\nWhat you say is true, and interesting.\n\nHowever, you know that regarding african americans, they are around 20% to 50% white. So when does a black people stop to be of african descent? When does he \"become\" white? Is the DNA related to abstract reasoning dominant or recessive characteristic? \n\nEven if we were to all mix ourselves in one race (i'm not  an advocate of this). Would we be stupidest than now? Or is the intelligence genes dominant, so it won't really matter in the end? By the way, mixing people don't make the gene disappear, even if it's recessive. E.G, if a blue eye (blue-blue alleles) have children with a brown eye (brown-brown alleles), the children will be brown eye, but the child, even can have blue eye children if he have children with a blue eye person or a brown blue allele person (1/4 chances).  However, if the gene become negligible in proportion, it could somehow disappear, but then the sexual selection intervene. Successful, thus most intelligent men (most of the time), will have more children, or at least enough children, so there genes will still be passed down future generations. \nSo no, in theory, there is no risk that the human intelligence disappear. Asian will probably be the most dominant ethnic group in a century anyway.",

There's other ways to keep the economy going other than by making worse profits, like by making better products, or by inflating prices by cutting on maximum permitted work hours. \n\nIt's not only about inflation, but about the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. \n\nThe more mechanization happen, and we all agree there will be more and more mechanization in the future, the more the rate of profit fall. In the end, even selling non needed goods regularly won't be enough. Prices drop and drop but people don't need goods they already have, which are produced in a bigger and bigger quantity and at a cheaper and cheaper price.

It doesn't make sense either.\n\nhttps://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/world-rate-simple-mean.png\n\n>Mechanisation increases profit, not decreases it. Labour costs go down, profit goes up.\n\nHere is the abstract part. You should understand it yourself, but i'll help you.\n\nAt first, after some mechanization in a particular production line, profit go up because more goods are sold. This competitor has an advantage: he produce more for a lower price.  However, later, competitors do the same in order to keep up, and mechanize. More goods are sold on the market.  What happen then? Prices go down. Less profit is made for a particular item for all the competitors. Selling a particular item give less profit,  because more items of this kind are on the market.  You'd say: it's not a problem, we'll sell more of the stuff to compensate. At first, it'll work. And planned obsolescence will help. However,  here is the critical point: who need 200 pens, 15 cars, 18 laptops. No one.  At one point, goods will be cheaper and cheaper, profit will be compensated by selling more, but you can only sell as many as people want, or need.  At one point, less and less people will buy the particular good, until no one will buy it. This is capitalism final crisis. \n\nAlso, be realistic: take an abstract example: one production line: 100% automated, extremely energy efficient (In the future,  in 50- 80 years from now). Manufacturing goods in this particular production line will cost nothing. Same for the competitors. Thus the price of the goods will be nothing. Thus no profit. \n\nIt's quite simple but many are not conscious of this law of the rate of profit to fall.",

You'll have relocation, whether you like it or not. \nAll of our current standard of living is based on the fact that chineese worker manufacture our daily items for wages 10 times lower than in the west. \nAs i said before, the only way for no relocation to happen is if there were no countries with different legislation anymore. One world government of some sorts. However, most of the people don't want this, and i understand them. \n\nI, for myself, don't like the concept of nations, because it was itself created by the capital, however, a world government is not the abolition of money and the state, but just one big capitalist and technocratic  super-state, and probably totalitarian (see Orwell or Aldous Huxley). \n\n\n> I said before I don't think it'll last forever, because a zero production cost will kill capitalism and will boost cooperatives. I'm also in favour of a universal basic income, to make the evolution smoother. I actually advocated for subsidising cooperatives in our federal parliament in 2014, and also lobbied for a universal basic income at the same occasion. While since then there is now a vast interest in cooperatives in our country, I do not see the universal basic income happening as long as people do not actively fight for it.\n\nI'm skeptic about the basic income. Looks like Tittytainment from Zbrezinzky. Also basic income would put the beneficiaries of this basic income on the hand of the state which allows it. And since the state is in the hand of the capitalist class (owners of the mean of production), it'll put them in the hand of this capitalistic class. \n\nIt could also create a third class of people: the UBI people. \n\nWorkers have a strong leverage against the capitalistic class: general strike. \n\nWhat leverage does basic income people have? None. If they don't behave, the state will just shut their UBI down. \n\nThe hand which gives is always above the hand which receives. \n\nI won't fight the basic income. However, people should not be naive, and understand that there could be some bad side effects about this basic income. It could also create inflation, and increase housing prices and cost of living for the working class.  \n\nThere is also the problem of immigration. If you propose a basic income, everybody from countries were such  income doesn't exist, will try to come to countries were basic income exists.",

Platforms which doesn't belong to anybody.\n\n Those who want to post on traditional  central servers platforms could do so, but in those central servers platforms, self-censorship (coming from fear of being banned) is always a problem. \n\nEven here in Zerotalk Nofish has administrator rights. \n\nThe only forum systems which cannot be censored at all and that i use are Sone and FMS (in freenet).\n\n> thisweb11: Democracy and free speech only exists where everyone truly has an equal platform to speak, propose or share ideas, words and media.\n\nExactly. That's why using P2P networks like Freenet or Zeronet are  small steps further to real democracy. Here no one own anything. We all own everything.",

If I open a website about cats, I don't want random spammers to come talk about their religion or whatever.\n\nThis doesn't really happen if you have humans (people interferring with your content). Thus strong (but simple like images or very simple logic tests) captchas could garantee that you have humans.\n\nI only believe in local censorship, like  banning locally (on your install) an other person.\n\nIf there is a global censorship option, it must come from the majority, like in Sone or FMS in Freenet. In such system, you can ban locally (on your freenet install) as you like, but for someone to be globally banned, he must have a global review of less than -1 (between -100 and +100). \nTo my knowledge, no one has ever been globally banned in Sone and FMS, and there is no spam.",

That added to the fact that the average internet user don't use freenet.\n\n>It'll be really hard to enforce non-private ownership of digital information though, unless you want to keep track of everything everyone does on the internet, which is a very dangerous thing to do and in direct violation of privacy.\n\nI didn't say enforce. Everybody should be free.  \n\nNevertheless, in freenet, the content is encrypted and dispatched on everyone datastore. So it's anonymous, censorship resistant and nobody owns it.",
