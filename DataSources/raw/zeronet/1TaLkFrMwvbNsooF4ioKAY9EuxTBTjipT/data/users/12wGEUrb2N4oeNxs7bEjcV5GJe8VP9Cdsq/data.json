Demonsaw is problematic in that it's not open source and it hasn't been audited; there's no way to know that it's not recording everything you share and say and reporting it to law enforcement.\n\nIndeed, I edited the post to add some link for a better understanding. In the meantime Demonsaw is still a great software to share files.",
