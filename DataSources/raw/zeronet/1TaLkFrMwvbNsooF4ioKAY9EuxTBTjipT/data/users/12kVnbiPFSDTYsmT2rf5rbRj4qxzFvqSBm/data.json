Running a MMO game is probably more of the latter one, where the challenge is to reply to a player in real time and keep a \"massive\" amount of users in a consistent state, rather than the complexity of the computation itself. \nI certainly like the idea of decentralized computation, though I might think it will emerge in other forms first.",
