It's the feeling you get when you know you can have the person but just *being* with them is enough. It's sex, happiness, emotion and it's friendship. Love is knowing that out of all the crazy people in the world that one is the chosen one. It's understanding and a feeling of completion. Love is a chemical reaction that stayed with us because of its efficiency in getting us to fuck and have babies.\n\nLove transcends explanations. It's completely intangible and yet something that most people can feel.\n\nLove is a feeling that when goes away makes you empty, makes you feel like all that love was a lie, that nothing makes sense, that only a new love will make things better.\n\nWell, let's not fool ourselves. Love is a ***reward*** to and an incentive of sex. How could we reward something that is no more?\n\nThat is why I say: love everyone, enjoy life, share love and get love but never let love *become* you, it's only good while it lasts.",

I'm asking because that sounds like a definition of love that a parent would give to their children. I'm from Russia, and people here talk about love in completely different manner.\n\nI would rather not say where I am from.\n\nThat was the most no-bullshit answer I could think of. \n\n> Also, I was expecting \"Baby don't hurt me\" much more than an actual answer, but that stuff is probably too obvious to mention.\n\nThat's pretty funny.\n\nI would like to know how love is defined in Russia, would you mind sharing?",

I'm saying this because putting emphasis on you not being gay doesn't seem to me like a super nice way to say « hey you gay come to my place and let's talk ». And gee ! I'm sure gay people on your blog (and in your life) would do you no harm, on the contrary. ;-)\n> Pax\n\nSorry, I didn't mean that to sound like a negative or offensive statement. I wrote it that way because I understand *gay* as homosexual and I consider myself pansexual. That's why I used italics. But of course I have no shame in saying that I like male, female and everything in between :)",
