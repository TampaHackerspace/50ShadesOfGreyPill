You can't automate web design... You can try automating layouts by using composability, but someone has clearly never had to work on the frontend of a large scale website before.\n\n> Microsoft should once again develop its basic language. Interprets natural language into programming language. Used to design web pages.\n> Now the CPU speed is fully able to do this.\n> If the web design can not be natural language, then the natural language of programming is simply impossible.\n\nYou sound like a crazy person. Natural language is great, and something like a fourth generation language for composing websites seems possible, but it has nothing to do with Microsoft.",

I think the ideal setup for a lot of people is Apple/Mac hardware and then run linux on it.\n\nI prefer my own hardware... I managed after much work to get Ubuntu running on an old Mac Book Pro, but the EFI bootloader is a pain in the ass, and the drivers aren't as great. I would say it's pants-on-fire false that Apple hardware is what most people prefer to put their Linux distro on. For laptops I think more people put Linux on a Thinkpad.\n\n>  Personally, I've gotten too comfortable with OSX's UX features to make a comfortable switch to linux for now. But you should support free/open software when you can.\n\nUnity DE and ElementaryOS both have rather similar UX patterns as OSX. I personally hate the OSX UX, mostly because it's slow and in the way. I prefer running OpenBox.",

Fleeing the Russian Revolution, they clearly had seen the way of Sovietism and decided that's what they were going to try to create in China!\n\nYou would have to really have no education to believe this shit.
