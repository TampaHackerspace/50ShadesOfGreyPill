				"body": "> [lukipuki](#comment_41_1CMYxdit4qq9QGk9DYRu2ruRPd2YDGckH8): yes! Curators or moderators could be something like 'collections subscribtions' and 'filter subscribtion'. They could be added voluntarily by every zeronet user to influence the seeding behaviour of the own node.\n> I would like for example to have a blacklist that i can subscribe to that is automatically blocking every user or post that someone (i trust) put onto the blacklist. This could prevent users (me) to seed illegal content. It could also prevent me from content that I just don't want to spread (nazi propaganda for example - but then I would probably have to subscribe to another list/curator).\n> I want to expand a little on the idea.There could be single curators and collectives of curators. A single curator could be an expert in a certain topic - It would be like reading her/his blog (which would have links to other sites). A collective of curators could just be a group of people. Maybe like the circles of google+. A post's rating would get a higher significance (for me) if some people in a circle i have subscribed to are sharing/blocking it or have liked/disliked it.\n\nYour idea is like a chatroom ,ZN is a web.",
