Too much stupid kiddy here.\n\nRating individuals != censorship but can certainly lead to it. \n\nI don't care if sites run their own \"reputation\" based off of users and even if other sites only allow users of a certain \"reputation\" from particular sites they choose. \n\nThis is already doable as a site creator. However If you want something like that why not just go back to facebook on the clearnet? It's what \"likes\" basically are. \n\nThe censorship would be very prevalent if it was built into the protocol that you couldn't access content that was downrated by enough people. This would be ripe for abuse by state actors, big companies, and ideologues of all stripes.",
