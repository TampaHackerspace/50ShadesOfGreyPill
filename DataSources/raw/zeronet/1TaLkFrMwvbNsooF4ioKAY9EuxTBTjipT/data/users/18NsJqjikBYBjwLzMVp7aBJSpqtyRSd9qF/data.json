Because the mobile's storage capacity is too small.\n\nPeople use a lot of mobile devices, and being able to use Zeronet on them would make people like it more. Also, streaming data instead of downloading is becoming more popular (like Netflix/Spotify/Youtube), so being able to do some amount of that is a good idea too.\n\n> For example, from 100000 personal computers constitute zeronet basic network, each computer to take 30G hard drive capacity, 100000X30G = 3000T. So big a P2P database, how to build? How to run How to maintain This is the real problem.\n\nThat example isn't totally right. A network can be very redundant, or have high capacity, but having more of one means having less of the other. You can have more of each, but that's much harder. ([this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) explains it a little more).\n\nFor example, if there was only one site with a size of 30GB, then the whole network can only store 30GB. I know it's not really like that--but in the real network, just adding up the storage of each device isn't correct.",
