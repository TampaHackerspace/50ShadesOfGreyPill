				"body": "Jews are against Trump because he is not fully supporting the Jewish agenda and full world domination of Jews.\nhttps://jewsagainsttrump.us/\n“Progressive” Zionist Peter Beinart says that the “dirty little secret” of Jewish politics is that Jews don’t decide who to vote for based on Israel. Why should they, when all candidates for public office are slavishly devoted to that alien entity?\nDonald Trump is a case in point. He is militantly pro-Israel and even has an Orthodox Jewish daughter, but faces nothing but hostility from the Jewish establishment because he takes some stands that could be considered pro-white. This should be a lesson to anyone who thinks Zionism is simply a devotion to a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. The fact is that Zionism is Jewish supremacy across the globe.\n\nIt is unprecedented how the Jewish owned media incites criminal elements to murder the elected US president.\nThey can permit to do it because they are Jews. By others it would be called inciting to terrorism.",
