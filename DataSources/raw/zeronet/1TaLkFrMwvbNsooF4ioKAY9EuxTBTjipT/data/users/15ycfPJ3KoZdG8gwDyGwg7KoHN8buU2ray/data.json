His body was found in a cellar of a Jewish owned house in Trento, Italy by local magistrates.\n> Ariel Toaff is a professor of Medieval and Renaissance History at Bar Ilan University in Israel, whose work has focused on Jews and their history in Italy.Ariel Toaff is the son of Elio Toaff, late former Chief Rabbi of Rome.\n\nWhy the Jews sacrifice babies and put Gentile baby blood in the matzo ?\n1. Jews must drink baby baby blood otherwise they are not really Jews after the Kabbalah.\n2. Blood alone is not so tasty so they make a kind of sandwich, like a hamburger with matzo.\n\n\nhttps://firstlightforum.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/why-the-jews-sacrifice-babies-and-eat-gentile-blood-in-the-matzo/",
