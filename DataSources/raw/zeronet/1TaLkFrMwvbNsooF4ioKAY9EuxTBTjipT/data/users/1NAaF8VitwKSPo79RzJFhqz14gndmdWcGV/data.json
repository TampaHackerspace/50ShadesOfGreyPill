Sounds good to me!\n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve involved but it is doable with the right tutorials (That's how I learnt it).\nWith virtualbox you can create a computer inside of your computer and install an OS in it. Now I could write a book but there's a lot of information out there on Google.\n\nLooks like you have MacOS. You should have at least 2 GB RAM free for your virtual machine and a nice CPU as your hardware will be shared by two computers.\n\n1. First of all, you will need to download the virtualbox software on your computer. Get virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\n\n2. Get an ISO file for the OS you want to install - for Linux (for absolute beginners Mint Cinnamon would be a good choice as the UI is similar to Windows, simply head to https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=217). \nIf you want to install Windows, you can get an iso (at best Win7 64bit) from a torrent website, e.g. pirate bay or maybe you have a physical disk at home. For Windows you would neen an activation crack as well of course. \n\n3. To create a virtual machine with virtualbox and the iso, you will find thousands of guides online, e.g. http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-use-virtualbox/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL7Dh6drlBw\n\n4. You will have a computer inside a computer, on which you can install ZeroNet.",
