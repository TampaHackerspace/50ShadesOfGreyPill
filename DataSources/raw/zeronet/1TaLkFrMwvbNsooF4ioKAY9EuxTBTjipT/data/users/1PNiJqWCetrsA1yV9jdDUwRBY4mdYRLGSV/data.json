In the official history children were selected by arriving in the 'Auschwitz death camp' and immediately sent to the 'Gas chamber'.\nLook the Jewish accordion player smoking pipe and the camp orchestra(one from 16). The camp had a schedule plan for high level concerts with good instruments for the entertainment of inmates.\nSee the camp library where inmates could borrow books from forty-five thousand volumes available and the schedule plan for the camp soccer championship and the soccer ground.\nWatch the interviews with 'Jewish survivors' from the 'Auschwitz death camp' were non-bribed 'survivors' are laughing about their various and interesting experiences from Auschwitz.\nA Jewish woman will attest that her barrack had a high quality piano and a violin-quartet and she had joyful experiences with the camps free activities.\nA 'Jewish survivor' former inmate's only complain about Auschwitz was that the beer was 'weakish'(low alcohol level).\nhttp://whale.to/b/auschwitz_theatre.html\nhttp://whale.to/b/eric_hunt.html\nhttp://rense.com/lets_stop_with_the_auschwitz_lies.htm.html\nhttp://www.wintersonnenwende.com/scriptorium/english/archives/articles/ccmoney.html",
