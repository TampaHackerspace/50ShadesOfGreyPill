Jew changed it to \"Russia who is the problem\". http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:2_17LQPJZz9sBC1besM5ZwKFKt9CmndJTjcA/The+Central+Bankers+are+Jews+and+are+trying+to+start+a+war+with+Russia\n\nI agree with freedom of speech, but can we downvote posts like this? No downvote option makes it easy for trolls to spam and discredit Zeronet. If it gets too popular, that's how they'll try and take 0net down.",
