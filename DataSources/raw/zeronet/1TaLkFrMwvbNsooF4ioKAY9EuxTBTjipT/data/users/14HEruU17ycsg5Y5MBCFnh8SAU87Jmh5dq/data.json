Better to just look past it instead of engaging.\nNot saying that I'd personally find blindly discriminating anyone for any reason being anything but stupid, in the end it's a two-way road when you really think about it.\n\nI haven't checked ZeroTalk that much, not sure if there's been any decrease in off-topic nonsense but the mute button should solve the issues of trolls and the likes from derailing topics. Hopefully it won't turn into a \"I don't like what you said so I'm just gonna pretend you don't exist\" kinda scenario, sometimes it just works to shrug things off and do something else instead of semi-erasing the writings of a online identity.\n\nBut eh; I'd like to think people are smarter and can handle the tools given to them, but that's a whole discussion of it's own and I'm rambling enough as is.",
