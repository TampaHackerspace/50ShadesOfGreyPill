				"body": "I think there is a difference between adblocking and torrenting.\nRegarding adblocking:\nI think most people aren't against adds in general but  against annoying pop up, full site, flashing and slowing adds. Which are the most adds a the moment. If you annoy your customers they won't visit your site or install an adblocker.\nSame problem with torrenting:\nIf you annoy your customer they won't buy your product. I reckon the biggest problem the separation of the world in regions. If I can't get the content because I live in country x, it's more likely to get pirated. Same goes for ease of consumption If I have to install apps and Stuff to view things it's easier to pirate them.\nSo give people an easy way to get your content and they will.",
