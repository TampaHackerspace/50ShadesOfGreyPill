Its like asking shareholders to take less profit to help the poor. Never happens, I can't think of a single company who says to shareholders 'lets give away our profits and take home less'. Even the state is reluctant to increase taxes. Int he US and the UK corporation tax has been decreasing. In the uk it is 20% in the 80s it was 70%. Capitalism drives to sharing less, because sharing less means gaining more profit, and thus more capital, known as capitalism!\n\nI neeeed your sources ! Really need it !",

It is now 20% .\n> https://www.figurewizard.com/list-uk-corporation-tax-rates.html\n\nThank you, your debate is very interesting ! :)\nI must say that @binero's arguments are not very convincing: no sources, and most of them are based on \"this is the current system so the other cannot do the same\".\nMaybe if you tried to understand the anarchist's arguments you could argue better.\n(I'm a convinced anarchist, so I don't have anything to add to your arguments @thisweb13)",
