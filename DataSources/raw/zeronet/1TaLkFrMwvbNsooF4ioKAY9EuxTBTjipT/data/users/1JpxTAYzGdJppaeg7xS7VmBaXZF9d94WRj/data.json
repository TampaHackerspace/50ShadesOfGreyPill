So, let me repeat looking at ZeroTube now... sadly still not working... it looks like before...\n> Aside of that I think in this particular case you're right with your assumption, that you need to be online for others to watch it. But only because you're the only one offering it right now. When more people are viewing it, the complete video will be in the network independently from you. That's the magic of ZeroNet of being not just decentralized - like MediaGoblin - but even distributed.\n\ni got 4 to 9 peers on all videos , i used zeronet on mom's laptop , i can watch all the videos i posted for the test , still no previews , but the video is running smoothly , the zeronet app works too on my phone on zerotube",

So the torrents probably need to be running on skylakexts' end regardless of my seeding?\n> No online trackers means no ZeroTube videos.\n\nSoooo we need a server to ermanently run the webtorrent in order to keep everything on zerotube running .... that might be an issue ...",
