Thanks to the reach of the Internet people are waking up to this, and so fascism, like nature, is beginning to reassert itself. There's no reason to fight the inevitable turning of the great wheel of renewal, unless of course you're a committed degenerate or a subversive Jew, in which case it's very likely your _final_ bill is coming soon.",
