You should be blaming the politicians and multi-billion dollar companies that are pushing for the internet to be censored.\n\nAny cop who doesn't arrest a dirty cop is just as dirty. They do deserve hate, but I wish it was focused on the known murderers instead of random ones. Why don't terrorists believe in due process?",
