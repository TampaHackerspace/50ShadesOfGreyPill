				"body": "On April 16,  2005, just a week before the beginning the the Jewish Passover on April 23, five children, Muslim and Christian, disappeared in the Russian Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. Four weeks later, their burnt bodies were found in a sewage pit.\nVladimir Salamatov, the lawyer representing the interests of the parents of the murdered children told the paper that 5 independent expertises confirmed the lack of hemoglobin in all burnt bodies.\nI am sure that it was a ritual murder with exsanguination, he said.\nEvgeny Kazantsev, the Head of Untraditional Religious Groups Monitoring Center, agrees that it was a ritual murder. \nA Moscow independent researcher and journalist, Mikhail Nazarov, stresses that there is a large Jewish community in Krasnoyarsk and that the authorities do their best to conceal this ritual murder committed by the Jews. A witness reported seeing the bodies of the children thrown intact in the pit as proscribed by the Jewish ritual and then somebody burnt then to conceal ritual wounds in specific places of the bodies made for the exsanguination, Mr Nazarov said.  Few people in the city believe that the Jewish murderers ever come to trial.\nBlood of gentiles is still used by Hasidic Jews for ritual purposes. \nhttp://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=5412\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism\nhttp://abc7ny.com/religion/ny-judge-denies-injunction-upholds-hasidic-public-practice-of-chicken-slaughter/984189/\nHasidic Judaism is an orthodox esoteric branch of Judaism with over 600 000 members, most of them living in the USA. It is supposed that Hasidic Judaism is still frequently practicing ritual murdering.",
