One time I was just searching around and I came across a site with philipeno news stories. I don't speak philipeno so it's no use to me. But I surely would be happy to seed it for people who do speak philipeno. I deleted it from my directory because I didnt want random asian characters on my welcome screen but it would have been nice to have the option to continue to seed without seeing it on my welcome screen.",
