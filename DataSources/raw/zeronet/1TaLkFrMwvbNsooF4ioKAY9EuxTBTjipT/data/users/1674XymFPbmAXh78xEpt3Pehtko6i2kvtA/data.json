I know it since its beginning. I really like it very much. I would like to contribute to their projetc when I will learn Python. In future, I have a lots of Web project for Zeronet such as a Diaspora*-like version to its manner, another type of decentralized network - but social, this time.\n\nWell cordially and thank you people for having read it.\n\nYou can contact me to: alexandre@zeroid.bit\n\nAlexandre, a french Zeronet's user. \n:-)",
