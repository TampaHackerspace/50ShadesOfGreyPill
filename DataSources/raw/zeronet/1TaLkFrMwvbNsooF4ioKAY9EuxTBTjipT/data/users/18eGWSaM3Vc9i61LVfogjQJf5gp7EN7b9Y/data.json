Given that it's an HTTP connection, my ISP could easily be injecting traffic into the packet. Can anyone confirm this? Script is apparently titled PostRPC, which a quick google gives as Microsoft's Remote Procedure Call. Can post what I see if needed.",

If you are a US citizen, please please PLEASE call your senators RIGHT NOW. The link has phone numbers for those that are sympathetic. If you care at all about an uncomprimised Internet, this is something you need to spread, or the dollar-per-hollar shills will make life that much harder. \n\nhttps://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-23-congress-votes-today-on-whether-to-gut-the-fccs/\n\nEDIT: Now it has to pass the House of Representatives. Just as a reminder: If the House votes yes, your personal data such as which banks you visit, hospitals and doctors you trust, your worker associations, all of that can and will be inferred from the metadata that the ISPs will be allowed to collect and sell, potentially making you get blackballed from a higher-paying job or targeted for discrimination. PLEASE call your reps and tell them to vote no on the CRA vote on Tuesday.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/we-have-24-hours-save-online-privacy-rules",

				"body": "Right then, couple of hours lat but screw it.\n\nWine is not meant to be run by itself. Instead it's a compatibility layer to translate the system calls from Windows dotexes to Linux ones, and back again on the return trip. Running Wine by itself would be futile, so there's no premade shortcut. Instead, make an empty text document with the ```.desktop``` extension, i.e. ```wine-program.desktop``` following the example set by any that you currently possess on your machine. For example, this will work to start the ZeroNet.sh script:\n\n```[Desktop Entry]\nName=Start Zeronet\nComment=Censorship-resistent internet\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"cd /path/to/Zeronet/dir/  && ./ZeroNet.sh\"\nIcon=/path/to/znet_logo.jpg\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;FileTransfer;```\n\nThe ```[Desktop Entry]``` header is required to tell the system to start treating the file like a desktop entry, although due to the standard ```.desktop``` extension some systems can get away with just looking at the filename. Without it, most window managers display a text document icon, and the system opens it as a text document upon doubleclick.\n\n```Name=...``` is the displayed name of the shortcut when it is rendered by your window manager. Note that this does not change the filename; if you are interacting with it via the shell, you will need to specify whatever you saved it as, not what the line reads.\n\n```Exec=...``` is the command line that runs your given application. This example would navigate to ```/path/to/Zeronet/dir/``` and, if the directory exists, run the executable script or binary named ```ZeroNet.sh``` in the current directory. I prefer this way because it makes the ```$PWD``` environment variable be passed to the script's shell, preventing some bugs that can be difficult to track down.\n\n```Icon=...``` is the path and filename to the image file displayed by the shortcut. Depending on your system, it may only support jpegs, so be sure to convert if you are uncertain.\n\n```Type=...``` tells the system to open it as this MIME type. Typically, this will be Application.\n\n```Terminal=...``` tells the system to spawn or not spawn a terminal window when running the application via this shortcut. Typically, when running an application via the GUI, one doesn't want a popup :P\n\nCategories and Comments are typically optional. For more information, try the following two links:\n```https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles```\n```https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/```\n\nSo let's try this with a Windows app under Wine. Wine is special, since by default its desktop files reference the wineprefix's emulated Windows filesystem. Try the following Exec=... line:\n```Exec=env WINEPREFIX=/home/<insert username here>/.wine/ wine C:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\command\\\\\\\\start.exe C:\\\\\\\\path\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\exe\\\\\\\\file\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\wineprefix``` assuming that the dotexe is located (or even symlinked >:)) to a file in the wineprefix. This sets the environment variable ```WINEPREFIX```to the root of the wineprefix, which is required and will be created/populated if not extant, tells Wine to start the Windows program starter, which then starts the file specified.\n\nFor troubleshooting, first ensure you have permissions to execute both the ```.desktop``` file and the dotexe.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

That will give any maliciously-infected Windows executable root access to your system, leading to Bad Things (tm).\n\nC: Making a ```.desktop``` file is the standard way of starting applications via the GUI. On Ubuntu, ordinary ```apt-get``` installs automatically do this by copying a prebuilt to ```/usr/share/applications``` folder, where they show up in the Unity Dash searchbox. Try the ```gnome-panel``` package, and the ```gnome-desktop-item-edit``` tool. This will be the only time you need to interact with the command line, assuming you plan ahead and create a new dotdesktop file to create new dotdesktop files :P\n\t1: Open a terminal and install the ```gnome-panel``` package with the following command line:\n\t\t```sudo apt-get install gnome-panel --no-install-recommends```\n\t2: Execute the following to open the GUI, while creating a new dotdesktop:\n\t\t```/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit /home/$USER/Desktop/ --create-new```\n\tThis functions because it is invoking the program, then the first argument says to place this new dotdesktop file in the directory specifed (feel free to replace the $USER with the name of your user, since the command is being invoked by your terminal, it will expand to whatever the ```USER``` environment variable is for that particular shell, can cause problems if you have a nonstandard shell) \n\t3: At the GUI, you will see an icon on the left, and a few fields. Click the icon to bring up a file picker and navigate to whatever icon you want displayed. \n\t4: Type should remain Application. Name will be whatever you want displayed by your window manager. Comment can be ignored, but may be useful if you ever come back to edit it and forget what the dotdesktop is for :P\n\t5: Finally, onto the Command field. This is what the ```Exec=...``` line is mapped to. Wine is special in that you will need to prefix the Linux location of the Windows executable with some arguments in order to make it work. For this example, I will be using ```/home/rythyrix/Desktop/catplanet.exe``` as the Windows executable I want to invoke.\n\t6: Obtain the Linux path of the executable to invoke, and the wineprefix you want to use as the root of the Windows system. In this case, ```/home/rythyrix/.wine/```\n\t7: Open a text editor, as it's easier to just copy/paste into the Command box of the Create Launcher GUI. Keep in mind that the dotdesktop file will not create\n\t8: Assemble the line as follows: ```env WINEPREFIX=\"<your wineprefix here>\" wine C:\\\\windows\\\\command\\\\start.exe /Unix \"<your Linux executable path here, with no expansions>\"``` For example, my line would be ```env WINEPREFIX=\"/home/rythyrix/.wine/\" wine C:\\\\windows\\\\command\\\\start.exe /Unix \"/home/rythyrix/Desktop/catplanet.exe\"```\n\t9: Copy/paste the completed command line into the Command box, then click OK. If all went well, you should now have a new dotdesktop on your desktop. Double-click  on it to test if it works.\n\t10: To make a dotdesktop to make new dotdesktops on your desktop (what a mouthful), place the following command line in the Command box: ```/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit /home/<your username here>/Desktop --create-new```, adjust Name/Icon as desired, and click OK. Keep in mind you cannot use environment/tilde expansion in the Command box, so you need to type the path without such expansions.\n\t11: If you are ever interested in learning the command line, this is a good place to start: ```http://www.linuxcommand.org/index.php```\n\nQuestions still welcome.",

Not resumming optional files enables zites to quickly publish new content. On the other hand, when one signs their zite, how does the parser tell not to resum? Timestamp checking, whilst useful, can be defeated with a simple ```touch -t $(date -d @UNIX_EPOCH_SECONDS +%y%m%d%H%m.%S) FILE```.

You could have alice@kaffie.bit and alice@zeroid.bit , if you felt so inclined.

It's still not a replacement for trackers, due to the insular outcome; every peer sends every other peer the list of peers they know, but no new peers can connect short of manually editing the file and attempting the connection. If two sets of peers rely only on PEX, and there isn't at least one peer in common between the two sets, then those two sets will never meet. Thus, trackers are still a needed thing. Now, if there was say a zeronet-hosted tracker, there's the problem of updates with them, and naturally, as it is hosted on  ZeroNet, all such information would be public. Also runs into problems of hidden services, due to ZeroNet by default randomizing the onion addresses it uses at each startup, due to regenerating the SSL cert used to encrypt communications.",
