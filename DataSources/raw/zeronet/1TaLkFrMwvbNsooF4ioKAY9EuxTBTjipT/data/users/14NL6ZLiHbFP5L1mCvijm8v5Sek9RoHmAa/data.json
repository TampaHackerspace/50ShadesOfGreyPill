PRIVATELY with my friends.So of course, some privacy-enhanced fb-lik thingy run on ZN would be perfect.privacy enhanced means: end to end encrypted, authenticated, severless, hiding meta data (to whom I am connected), etc.\n\nYeah, using Facebook is like passing a note to your friend in class but having it checked by the teacher first. If you sign up for it and have no problem with the possibility that everything can be read, then go ahead. However, for those who try hard to lock down their account from the outside world to keep it among their friends, the site is simply not fit for purpose.",
