				"body": "Typhus and the Jews\nBy the Polish Jews persisted the medieval concept before the second world war that bathing is not healty and is a sin against God.\nThis was confirmed by British doctors also which visited Warsaw in peace time.\nPolish Jews lived in highly unsanitary surroundings, in which typhus had, in fact, already reached epidemic proportions and from where typhus was more than likely to spread despite a strict quarantine imposed by the Germans. Polish Jews accounted for roughly 3/4 of all known cases of typhus for all of Poland not only during the early part of World War II but also during the years following World War I after German troops had left.\nThey are protocols from Auschwitz where the German SS couldnt convince the Jewish community to go bathing not even by treatening them to shoot dead if they dont go bathing.\nhttp://www.ihr.org/jhr/v08/v08p433_Berg.html",
