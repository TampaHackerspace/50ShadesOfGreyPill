Why should they, when all candidates for public office are slavishly devoted to that alien entity?Donald Trump is a case in point. He is militantly pro-Israel and even has an Orthodox Jewish daughter, but faces nothing but hostility from the Jewish establishment because he takes some stands that could be considered pro-white. This should be a lesson to anyone who thinks Zionism is simply a devotion to a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. The fact is that Zionism is Jewish supremacy across the globe.\n> It is unprecedented how the Jewish owned media incites criminal elements to murder the elected US president.They can permit to do it because they are Jews. By others it would be called inciting to terrorism.\n\nWe must boycott all Jewish products, especially media, and teach everyone we know to do the same.",
