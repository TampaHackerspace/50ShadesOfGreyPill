I've been T-boned on my motorcycle on more than one occasion.. you can't trust human drivers, sober or drunk, day or night.\n\nYea or at least everyone has to have self driving safety measures like automatic braking. Throw a 500 piece of equipment on every car/truck and drop the mortality rate by 5 times in one year. Just make it mandatory and give everyone the equivalent break in taxes. Win/Win.",
