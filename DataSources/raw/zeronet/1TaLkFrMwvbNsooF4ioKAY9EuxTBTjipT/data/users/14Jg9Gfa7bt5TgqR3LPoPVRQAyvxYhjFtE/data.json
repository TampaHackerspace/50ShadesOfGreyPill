However, there's no reason that ZeroNet pages can't link to/embed video content served on other networks, either legacy Internet or neonets like IPFS.\n\nYep that would be nice, it would be an invisible link between Zeronet and centralized internet. You could create false doors inside dem www with IPFS standard mode tri IP adress, and then open link to invisible Https site ! Wouldn't it be great ?",
