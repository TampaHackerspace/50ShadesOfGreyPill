I get an error when I login (NonType is not Iterable or some such nonsense), got a 404 when I went to click the add thread link (not the button, but the link in the contentwell), and via the button after writing my thread it hung on creating the thread. Voting doesn't work for me either (though it shows me as signed in, despite the login error). Looks like it could use some help - you have this mess in a repository?\n\nhi dun, we're working on it. i didn't see that error before, thanks for the info, i'll post an update here when its fixed.",
