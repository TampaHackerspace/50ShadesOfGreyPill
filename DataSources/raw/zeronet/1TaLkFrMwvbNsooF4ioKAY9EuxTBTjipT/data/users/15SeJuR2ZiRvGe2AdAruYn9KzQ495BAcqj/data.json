There's a measure called 'Yes California' that's going to be put up for a vote in 2018. And I think many people would be supportive of it. We are the 6th largest economy, after all. But the biggest issue is managing to convince the other states to let California go. No clue how easy/hard that'd be.\n> But the path is pretty clear: Vote yes to seceding -> Figure out the legal stuff -> get the majority of other states to agree -> Independent California!\n\ni thought the cal guys are just kidding.",
