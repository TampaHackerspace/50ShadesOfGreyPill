What I'm trying to do now is to find the best strategy to store the book content (title, metadata, files, authors, etc)\n\nI've tried to split the json files by book. One json file per book. This would be optimal for the backend system because updating a single book would mean updating a single json.\nThe problem with this was a huge content.json because of the SHA512 for each json file.\n\nI've also tried to bundle packs of 3000 books per file, this is resulting in files of ~4MB. But the problem would be that updating one single book in the pack would mean regenerating the whole pack and the nodes would need to download the whole file.\n\nI've also played with the idea of treating each book as a user content. So I could store one book per json and the files would not be included with the main site. The problem with this approach was the overhead of having one content.json per book (as we have with content produced by users now).\n\nWhat strategy would you recommend?",

On the other hand, you may have to write a script to organize books and sign files.\n\nThe downside of that is, as I've explained in my previous comment, if at some point another book from 2015 is added to the DB all seeds would need to re-download the whole file.",
