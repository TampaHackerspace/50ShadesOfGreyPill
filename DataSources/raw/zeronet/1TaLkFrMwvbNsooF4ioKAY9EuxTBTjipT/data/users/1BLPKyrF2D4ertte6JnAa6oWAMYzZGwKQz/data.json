Don't make it about anything else than it is: male to male homophobia. There is no _better_ culture when it comes to male homophobia so don't make it about migrants either. Male homophobia is a guy's fear of his own attraction towards other guys. It's about what your prostate does to your brain. It's just that some males have the intelligence to deal with it beyond being _afraid_ of it. Male homophobia is _all_ about stupidity.\n\nUPDATE 2016-06-15:  I have been on ZeroNet for a while. I know 99.99% of you guys are awkward virgin assholes that publicly pretend to be straight but exhibit typical homophobic closet confusion. Rings a bell ? _So_, I am just going to [drop this work in progress here](/tuetamere.bloccoq.bit/) to help you on your quest while I take care of my business on ZeroNet, trying to leave none of your narrow mind and even tighter ass unfucked.

It's tricky what ideas or ideals are referred to with this word \"love\". I know what sex is, though: it is the tropism, the motive that pulls human beings toward other human beings. It is our network protocol, a human TCP/IP over Ethernet. Sex, notably through rejection, through repression, through impossible desires and fantasies _is_ the most hurtful, tragic, destructive thing one will ever experience, _because_ it is also the most fulfilling and elevating.\n\n>  I don't understand.\n\nLet's see…\n\n> Here here.\n\nWell _this_ is where homophobia starts from. From an arbitrary sense of heightened morality that hides trouble. There is an Arcade Fire song that goes like this: \n\n_When they get excited, they try to hide it\nLook at those normals go\nWhen they get excited, they try to hide it\nLook at those normals go\nWhen they get excited, they try to hide it\nLook at those normals go\nWhen they get excited, they try to hide it... No!_\n\nSome try to hide it with moral authority, some with boredom, some with disgust. All of this is homophobia, all of this is incapacity to deal with homoerotic arousal susceptibility. With women it is different, women exhibiting homophobia towards their own sons, husbands, boyfriends, lovers, coworkers was best been explored by Godard in his movie _Contempt_.

I think nofish is doing a great job. He has his reasons. He did all this by himself. He can do whatever he wants. I think at least one fork is better than more devs at this point.\n\n> I think in the DercentralisedWebSummit, nofish was asked what he wants for this project. he replied he wants more people to develop websites. He didn't say more developers for the technology. Having a single dev is a bit risky IMHO.\n\nMy motive for forking is that I feel limited with the technology applied to the [content I'm producing now](/bloccoq.bit/). And I agree with nofish that what ZeroNet needs _most_ is indeed disruptive content (all I'm seeing now is content about ZeroNet). And _then_, from the people producing this content, should come the technological direction. And since we are free to fork, I think it is very wise of nofish to say that.",

It says something about Tor routers.\n\nThe message on [bloccoq.bit](/bloccoq.bit/) is a warning (in French) that says you have to have your Tor router setup properly so that your browser is able to resolve \".onion\" addresses if you want to see the videos. If you click on one of the links fanning out of the cock's mouth, for instance [Nouveau vloggeur](/nouveauvloggeur.bloccoq.bit/), the second one, there are 2 videos on this page. Both are hosted on a Tor onion service. If an error message appears when you click on either one of those 2 videos, it means your Tor proxy is not setup correctly. If everything is OK, it should take around 30 seconds to connect to the remote Tor service and the video should play.\n\nThe reason why I want to explore basic I/O in a POSIX C fork is that it gives me hope to be able to host larger files within the ZeroNet site bundles themselves and not rely on a third party solution. As it stands, you can either use IPFS and lose anonymity or use Tor and lose decentralization. Both also require extra non-trivial setup steps.",

More control over storage should come from ZeroHello for site-level information and actions, from the site-loading progress page for larger site (I think the default limit per-site should be raised to something around 200MB and the site content storage limit upgrade/downgrade system can be improved upon for sure). For file-level control within a site, something can be done with the side-panel UI.\n\nAlso, it is important to stress out that the use case I am concerned about is original, independent content and not torrent-like archiving of commercial feature-length 10-bit 444 H.265 video with surround sound that was meant for the theatre. For that, IPFS is fine. Right now, ZeroNet is perfect for text and image content where every file is less than 1MB. I want to improve on the 1MB limit because I think video bloggers and artists with disruptive things to say have nowhere to go and ZeroNet only needs small (performance) adjustments to make them feel welcome. _That_ is what I want to work on. _This_ is the use case I want to support.",

Compared to the original Open Source ZeroNet client, our apps are much faster, more stable, more energy-efficient, look better, install in a breeze and have continuous integration, and unit testing that – trust me – ensure a much higher quality level. And Apple has ways to check a binary submission to their App Store is not a security hazard for their users that are light years ahead of your naked eye source code analysis skills.\n\nThank God peeps like @p2p exist and are actually, along with Tamas and I, and my iOS coder friend, making ZeroNet _happen_.

I'm am not 100% done with testing [libzeronet](/libzeronet.bit/)'s content.json signing/verification routines yet but the \"patch\" that was done to the Python stack's \"modified\" float rounding error might not hold in the long term. I suggest that all the bulletproofing of ZeroNet interoperability as a protocol and the Python stack as a reference implementation be conducted more rigorously if possible. Listing all the problems and potential solutions somewhere official seems like a must now. Github's wiki and issue management is better than ZeroTalk for this, I think, but I'll go where you go. I think all of this is the proof that ZeroNet is all the better as it gets truly interoperable, even if it's due to the adversarial development of many concurrent implementations.\n\nAs a side note, I think libzeronet is better suited for mobile applications, specifically as it was designed to be completely stateless, and thus more energy efficient. But I cannot afford to loose focus on my current targets right now, which are: FreeBSD, Docker, Linux bhyve vm, macOS and iOS. And I think it's a good thing if the reference Python implementation can run in more platforms via Buildozer and Grumpy, including iOS. I think we will then be able to compare more rigorously.\n\nAnyways, keep up the good work.",

If you want to be able to express politically alternative ideas, do not get near weapons (let alone own them) or you they _will_ kill you the first occasion they get. I was interrogated by the police for anti-feminist things I said on Twitter and they told me flat out that if I had any weapons (I don't) registered or not, legally acquired or not, I would have ended up in prison that very instant. I was cleared on every account, but Canada is probably the worst place in the world to be a white male right now.",
