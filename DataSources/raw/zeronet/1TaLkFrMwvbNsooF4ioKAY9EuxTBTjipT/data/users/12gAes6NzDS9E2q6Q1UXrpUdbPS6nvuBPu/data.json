				"body": "Hi. I'm the creator of this Zite. I want to add that this Zite isn't fully complete yet. I still have ideas that I would like to explore. One of these Ideas is the ability to vote up Zite Requests, and once a Zite Request gets enough votes, it will be added to the main list. You can visit the [Github page](https://github.com/krixano/ImportantZites) to see more of my future plans and help out if you like by creating Issues or Pull Requests. All contributions are welcome!",
