			"title": "Big Site Feature",
			"body": "Hi all,\n\nI was thinking about having a special feature in ZeroNet for big sites. Basically, make servers seed big sites and disable seeding from clients. That way, we could have, per example, videos, images, and more hosted on a couple of servers. When there enough servers seeding, let the user choose to seed or not, saving disk space and bandwidth. Everybody *wanting* to seed could still seed, but others are not forced to.\n\nWhen one or two servers are down, automatically re-enable seeding from all clients. There should always be at least X copies of every file available. Like 20 or so.\n\nMaybe add a functionality to the client prioritising connections to servers as well.",
