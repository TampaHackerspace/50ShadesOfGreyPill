I suggest a popular Linux because of the drivers (OpenSuse, Debian, etc).  Umbuntu gets most of their money from Microsoft.  Most laptops and computers nowadays are GigaPets ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigapet) and the manufacturer can have a kill switch and burn some component.  I would take the risk but I'm a retired Assembly Programmer.",

Since this network is supposedly persistent and anonymous I suggest links to cut down on storage.  A good email service.  You are probably familiar with i2p so you can get your ideas from there.",
