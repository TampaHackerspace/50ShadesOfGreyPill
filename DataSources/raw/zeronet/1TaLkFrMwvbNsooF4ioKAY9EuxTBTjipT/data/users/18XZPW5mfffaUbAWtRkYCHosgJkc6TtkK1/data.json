BBS, ant then Web 1.0.I think ZeroNet has a lot of potential but it's too early to start bridging with the regular joe. ZeroNet is for a censorship free internet, and allowing people with sensibilities in now could actually hinder that goal.\n\nYeah, I agree. I actually expected the setup to be more difficult than it was, so making it simpler isn't something that should be done right now in my opinion.",
