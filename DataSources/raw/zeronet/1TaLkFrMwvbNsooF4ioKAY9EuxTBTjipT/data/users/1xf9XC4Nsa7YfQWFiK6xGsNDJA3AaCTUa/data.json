Some good Android wallets:\n[Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) - Completely decentralized SPV wallet that communicates in the P2P network to check incoming payments and broadcast outgoing payments. I'm using it for basic daily expenses. \n[Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) - Payments and balance checks are done by a central server, but you're still in complete control of your private keys. It can work with trust zone on some ARM phones and supports Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets via USB cable.\n[Copay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.copay) - Multi-signature wallet. You can share a wallet with someone, or use it as 2FA. It relays on BitPay servers, but as with Mycelium you're in control of your private keys.\n\nFor iPhone:\n[Breadwallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breadwallet/id885251393) - Not an iPhone user myself, so I can't tell you much, but AFAIK it's also an SPV wallet and you're in control of the private keys.\n\n\n\nMost wallets will ask you to make a backup right away. Please do not ignore it and make a backup. It will save your ass when you least expect it. In case of Mycelium, it will give you a 12 word seed. Write it down on a piece of paper. Bitcoin Wallet (by Andreas Schildbach) will give you password-protected file. Use a good password and copy it to some place other than your phone. Not sure about Copay or Breadwallet but the process should be similar.\n\n\nBE CAREFULL WITH APPLE APPSTORE. THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL CASES OF FAKE BITCOIN WALLETS REPORTED LATELY.
