			"body": "Hi I have one question about zeronet web hosting. Let's say I create a website, then I update my website regularly and the size of website is growing what will happen if the size of the website reach really big size something like 50GB and if someone don't have enough space on his pc. Is there a way to keep the size of website really small despite that I am uploading new content. I think that's a problem with zeronet.",
