The offer was made by the radical underground \"Fighters for the Freedom of Israel,\" better known as the Lehi or Stern Gang. Its leader, Avraham Stern, had recently broken with the radical nationalist \"National Military Organization\" (Irgun Zvai Leumi) over the group's attitude toward Britain, which had effectively banned further Jewish settlement of Palestine. Stern regarded Britain as the main enemy of Zionism.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Stern\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2I9i7xSSgmk\n\nActive Collaboration\nOn this basis of their similar ideologies about ethnicity and nationhood, National Socialists and Zionists worked together for what each group believed was in its own national interest. As a result, the Hitler government vigorously supported Zionism and Jewish emigration to Palestine from 1933 until 1940-1941, when the Second World War prevented extensive collaboration.\nhttps://justice4poland.com/2015/03/30/zionism-and-the-third-reich/",
