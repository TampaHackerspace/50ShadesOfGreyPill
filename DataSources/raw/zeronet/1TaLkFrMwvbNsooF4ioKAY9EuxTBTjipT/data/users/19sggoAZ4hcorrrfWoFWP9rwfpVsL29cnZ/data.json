My current dev version of zerotorrent has some bugs that need resolving (and i'm procrastinating) relating to optional_files improvements so it should scale better.  At the same time i'm trying to rope in some designers to help with the interface.\n> A couple of pain points:\n> \n> Lack of database migrations (think south/django).  There is already data in two formats on ZeroTorrent.\n> Lack of proper sanitization of user data (can be done in coffescript/js but there is nothing to stop people running modified script or creating the json data files manually containing malicious js; the solution to this might be to sanitize on read).\n> Difficult to prevent spam without moderation or it being a general pain in the ass (I have been thinking of doing some kind of POW like bitmessage to post, and clients could ignore posts without enough work,in theory this can be done in javascript)\n> Difficult to (reliably) setup a testing environment with real data, without fucking up prod site. \n> \n> I have also been anticipating the merger sites feature and I am taking a look to see how it could be used to further help scaleability.\n> If I can take a couple of weeks out I will evaluate all this and am considering starting from scratch and doing things less hacky this time (which would involve launching on a new address; the .bit would be updated, but we again fall on the issue of migrating user data, unless i create a single user to reupload everything currently on zerotorrent but comments will be tricky and attriution will be lost).\n> I am lurking around from time to time and I hear your calls for ebooks section and I promise to include this on the next update, however, as mentioned, reliably testing is a bit of a bitch and I am quite apprehensive about touching the live site as I have previously fucked it up due to database migration (change of schema) issues. \n> Need to get moving on this ........ \n> Btw, not beelzebub.\n\nTo make it easier for everyone, should start from scratch, the gang helps upload again, ta missing a cleaner version of torrent sites!",

The same goes for 'uncensorable' and other similar words. Focusing only on the scariest sounding scenarios is flawed thinking (like how some people are scared of being killed by lightning--despite stroke and heart disease being thousands of times more common). If you are concerned, Analyze and inspect the possibilities, but keep yourself grounded in reality.\n> Piggybacking off the torrent infrastructure eliminates a much more concerning what-if situation: 'what if we were using a custom zeronet-only tracking system and most of it was taken down?'  Instead, everyone who keeps torrent trackers online is also keeping Zeronet online, regardless of if they even know that Zeronet exists. \n> There are a lot of trackers in operation, some in countries that are much less vulnerable than others. Technically, this kind of doomsday situation could still happen, and a worldwide shutdown could be put in place--But It would be much more impractical. Not only would locating and catching them all spread this hypothetical enemy's resources very thin (and spark worldwide outrage that they would prefer not to deal with), but it would buy everyone else time to put up even more. Trackers are targets, but they are targets with a massive social shield in front of them.\n> But again, that's an extreme hypothetical situation. It's best to put effort into what's likely instead of wasting it on things that might never happen. Here are a few relevant things:\n> \n> If possible, donate to help develop DHT Functionality.\n> \n> If you can, actually help develop it (or recruit someone that can help).\n> \n> Same for i2p support.\n> \n> Keep tabs on what trackers are up (but not too obsessively, because we already have people for that).\n> \n> Learn Ham radio. Not as capable, but much more reliable communication.\n> \n> \n> And any other suggestions anyone might have.\n> P.S.: I'm probably going to move this to my blog and link it in a few days for better visibility.\n\nVery good your answer! =)",
