It couldn't be easier for a non-coder.After that you use any text editor to change colors. If people are afraid of text editor then they shouldn't be thinking to run a site. Certainly not expecting 99% of the internet to flock to that site. Expecting other people to do every last line of perfectly functioning code, keep your security and privacy intact and so on and so forth, just so that you don't have to even open a text editor once is disingenuous.\n> It is not right to run around where people are working every single day and night without lives to build something completely new and turning around and saying shit is broken so you are leaving. (i haven't even seen any posts @twiggydew has made about fixing or improving anything, which would be useful feedback) This post doesn't even mention a single bug. What are \"all of these bugs\" you mention? Anything not working needs to be explained, or it doesn't get fixed.\n> People are working hard, almost without exception for nothing in return other than praise. This 'huge golden carrot' (payday) for the project which reaches some level of perfection that is not explained isn't the way to use money to support hardworking individuals. How about asking for something very specific and offering a few hundred bucks to get it done. I mean Zeronet would not be here without the support Tamas has received from people who have been doing exactly that.\n\nI think twiggydew was talking about changing the zeroblogs background from white to a different color or using image for the background without having to mess with the css to do it. I can see what twiggydew is talking about there. I use wordpress and I don't have to go into the css to change anything on my wordpress blog, I do it with the wordpress cms. With a wordpress cms you can add banner, change the background color and you can even use templates. I noticed you can upload images to zeroblog easy but something needs integrated into it to add banners or headers like wordpress and an easy way to change the background, maybe even some zeroblog templates.",

I just automatically assume money is the main thing that limits people coding. (besides motivation, which is tied to money insidiously in our current society) But yes, the existing model (Googles, Facebooks, Twitter especially right now) are bad for lots of reasons which are well known. [...]\n\nMoney isn't the only thing, some people just hate to code. I've tried to code at least four times and every time I try to code I hate it even more. I even work with a group of kids younger than me and they made straight A's in coding at their school because it's a required course they had to pass. I tried to get them to try ZeroNet and as soon as I told them you had to be able to code some on the ZeroBlog to change the look of it they wanted no part of it. One of the guys said he hated JavaScript even though he made straight A's in it. I've even considered leaving ZeroNet because I can't do anything with my ZeroBlog, I'm just holding off on doing it because I'm hoping nofish can do something to the blog to make it so non-coders can use it better. I already quit promoting ZeroNet months ago because I finally decided I will only promote things I can use myself. I can't use ZeroBlog so there's really no reason for me to promote ZeroNet.",

But yeah, I have a lot of instability in my life at the moment and sometimes it's hard to focus on coding. Which is why there's such huge gaps in my development schedule. Hopefully though things are starting to work out and I can work on Kaffiene a bit more consistently. [...]\n\nI don't care for the look and feel of ZeroMe so I don't use it and I've tried multiple times to upload videos to KopyKate with no luck and there's to many steps needed to upload the videos, fifteen steps needed. All I have to do on youtube is log in then upload the video. I gave up trying to upload videos to KopyKate so I quit seeding the site. I only use ZeroMail, ZeroTalk and ZeroMusic and sometimes I post a picture to ZeroPlus. I'm just holding out to see if nofish can do something with ZeroBlog to make it more usable for non-coders. I heard nofish has been looking at this https://github.com/artf/grapesjs Hopefully he can add something like this to ZeroBlog, if not then there's no reason for me to stay.",

See with electric car. 30 years they are trying, and it's only taking off now. \n> Before ZeroNet there was freenet, and it think there will be an other P2P network in the years to come which will have a real popular success. \n> An all in one stuff like the Tor browser bundle would probably have more success. Download, click to install, use. \n> Most casual users don't understand why they should type http://127.0.0.1:43110/ in their adress bar. \n> In the end, P2P internet will be successful, not because people are awakened, but because it's more efficient : cheaper than huge central servers, like bitcoin vs the visa system,  no down servers, ddos immunity, could also be faster than central internet in a few years.\n\nI don't think this is twiggydew. I finally met twiggydew on Pidgin and on Pidgin he goes buy oracle. He said he's done a lot of research on decentralized internet and he likes ZeroNet but he thinks it's going to go nowhere like other decentralized projects like Freenet. He said coders who create these projects are unwilling to make them user friendly for non-coders. He brought up ZeroBlog needing a cms because the majority of the population use some form of cms. He said he had a friend who worked for General Motors and his friend tried to get General Motors interested in being one of the first companies to start a small website on Zeronet but they refused because there's no cms. Most of your businesses even use some form of cms. He also said coders who create these projects have a bad habit of getting angry when they hear negative comments about these projects but the coders fail to realize that the negative comments are to let the them know what they need to work on and they should appreciate getting negative feedback just as much as positive feedback.",

After the summer 2016 shutdown, i feel that there was an increase in interest in  Zeronet because of that, but now with Torrentz2 with onion mirrors and other mirrors in countries which are out of reach, torrents sites in the clear are even better than before.\n\nThey might take off a little bit but not a lot. I kind of think the same way as twiggydew though about the cms. A lot of people use them and so do businesses. I can go right now to my wordpress site and click on a button in the cms to change the background color or use an image for the background. On the ZeroBlog you can't do that, instead you have to go and change something in the css file. I'd rather have buttons to change the look of my ZeroBlog instead of going to the css file to do it. A lot of people feel the same way. So far I cloned the ZeroBlog and I've done nothing else with it because I don't want to go into the files and change anything. It'll probably stay that way till I delete it. I don't even want to mess with one line of code. I'm trying to find a cms that maybe nofish can integrate into ZeroBlog.",

There is a purpose, a goal and yes I'd call it a mission behind #redecentralize that makes projects like ZeroNet worth using, even if it isn't build YET(!!!) according to your highest satisfaction that was poured into you when using commercial and corporation infected web. You are right, it is not as easy to use, as the normal web. But is it not worth it to use it due to its big freedom and hugh mungus advantages for the people? Do you want to remain a corporate slave because they make using a channel or creating a blog a little easier and dumber for you? I don't think that is a valid reason. [...]\n\nI don't want to be a corporate slave but if I can't have things like a CMS or drag and drop on ZeroNet then I will stay on the centralized network and I'll just give up my privacy and security, many other people will do the same. What's the point of getting on ZeroNet if you can't use it. On the centralized networks it might be less private and secure but at least I can use it. Most non-coders will stick with what they can use. If you want to attract those non-coders to ZeroNet you have to add the same things they use on the centralized network. Think of the old saying - How to attract bees with honey. To non-coders features like drag and drop and CMS's are the honey.",

I guess i put the time to help someone who strongly supports Zeronet (Kai0 is very active to get more Chinese using it) also was prepared to learn. When people clone his zite, he'll likely take the time to explain it if they have the time to learn ..and so on. [...]\n\nI hope you have luck integrating something into the blog.",

Also you CAN use it. It's just not AS easy. But not really hard either. What if your daughter would be like \"nah, I don't wanna learn to ride the bicycle. They should make it easier to use for me.\"? Or they don't want to learn swimming, because there are boats. Don't want to learn math in elementary school, because we have calculators. What would you say to them? I want to give the same answer to you.\n\nI want to change the look and feel of my blog without coding anything. You can't force people to learn to code, it will never work. If you want to get more non-coders on ZeroNet you have to give them the same things they use on the centralized network. Not everybody likes to code. I've even tried to get kids younger than me to use ZeroNet and these kids made straight A's in school in Javascript. I wanted them to test ZeroNet and I told them that to change some things on the ZeroBlog you needed to code some stuff and as soon as I told them that they wanted no part of ZeroNet. You would think if a person that made straight A's in Javascript they would use ZeroNet but it turns out that's not true. They hate coding too and only made straight A's to pass their course. If you coders on ZeroNet  really want to help ZeroNet succeed and get more people to use it you have to give them the things they use, and thank you for your replies.",
