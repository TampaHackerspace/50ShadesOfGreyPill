But neither are all leaks available which are on my page nor via ZeroNet which offers are more easy to use built-in TOR functionality.\nHowever I do not want to make the impression I performed any hack myself. This is the reason why when possible it is mentioned within the files itself.",

But you cannot build up the hashsum of a \"magnet\" hash because you have any other kind of hash, you would need the actual file.\nIt is also with any other site or media that you are using, that you need to trust them (i.e. that they not modify all hashes). Same reason there is a very specific procedure you have to get \"Tails\" through official channels and not from anywhere else.",
