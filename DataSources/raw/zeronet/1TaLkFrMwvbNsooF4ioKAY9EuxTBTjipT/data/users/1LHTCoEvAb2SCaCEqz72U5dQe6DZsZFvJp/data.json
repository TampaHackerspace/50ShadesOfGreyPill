Every Jewish man, even converted adults must go through this ritual otherwise they are not considered Jews.\nThe blood contains the soul in the Jewish believe and has a special meaning. Only holly people may take human blood, mostly rabbis or Jews living for God. Jews having less connection to God may drink only animal blood.",
