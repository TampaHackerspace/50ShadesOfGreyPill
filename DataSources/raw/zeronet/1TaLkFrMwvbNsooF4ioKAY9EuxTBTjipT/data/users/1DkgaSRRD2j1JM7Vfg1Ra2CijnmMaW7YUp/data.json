You have to start ZeroNet first before Vidalia otherwise the Zero-server gets stuck configuring.  Lots of bugs and if it is only one dude working...  Tor does not work for me with ZeroNet but Vidalia kicks ass for speed!  ZeroNet works faster that i2p and for finacial reasons I think they should merge or cooperate.",
