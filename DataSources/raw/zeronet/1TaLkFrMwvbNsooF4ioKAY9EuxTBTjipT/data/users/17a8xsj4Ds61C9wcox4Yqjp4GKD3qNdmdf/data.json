Commodities that are merely consumed (or are the end-point of transaction) are personal. A commodity that is utilized as a way to gain surplus-value (i.e. buy a commodity with money, then sell the commodity for a profit) becomes private property or capital. This is the simple version of this distinction.\n\nYour PS4 or XBone aren't utilized as capital. You use them. There's an exchange-value but generally you are going to get less for it than you paid.\n\nAs far as slaves go, they were considered commodities under the capitalist system (though they existed before capitalism as well) and were considered capital because you owned them and gained surplus-value from them.",
