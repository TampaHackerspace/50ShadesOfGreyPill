The best future is this becoming the normal internet, since websites can still be moderated by their admins so we can totally have proper content, while still allowing for freedom cause anyone can host whatever website they want.\n\nThanks gremious, I actually have my concerns about it becomes something like the normal internet when we talk about regulamentation, all that bullshit and burocracy, but yeah one day would be nice to see this concept expanding horizons and working in other fields of aplication.",
