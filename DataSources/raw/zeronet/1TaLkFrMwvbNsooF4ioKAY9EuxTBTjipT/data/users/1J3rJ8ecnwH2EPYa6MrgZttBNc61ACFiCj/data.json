My understanding is that seeders should be able to decide whether to keep something or delete it.

DHT is planned later, but it's not a miracle solution, it also needs a bootstrap node, it adds lots of possible attacks and DHT on TCP is not really works well. (makes Tor clients much less functional)\n- Namecoin: Namecoin does not have lightweight resolvers yet (it's [planned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Namecoin/comments/2ug67c/lightweight_resolvers/), but i'm not sure if it's ever finished). Blockstack is still a new technology, not battle tested and the lightweight resolvers are not working yet, but it's looks a good alternative solution in the future. The easiest way to make it less centralized: create more third party zeroname clone sites and if 2 of 3 sites says the same, then it's probably fine.\n- ZeroMail: The decryption is done by the site's javascript code, so it's not possible to put messages on newsfeed. Cross-messaging would be nice, but it's not possible until ZeroMail is a simple ZeroNet site. (Probably [merger sites](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/232) will make it possible)\n- ZeroId: If you accept all zeroid provider by default then you loose the control over the users, anyone able to create unlimited users (makes impossible to remove misbehaving users).  You can create your own zeroid provider and then the sites able to accept it. Later it could be swiched to blockchain based id, but it would require everyone to own/destroy bitcoins on registration, which is a bad idea at current state of project. (I also dislike this solution, but have not found any better yet)\n\nSo thanks for the writing, the concerns are real, but they can be improved later. To solve most of this problems will also mean we need to rely more on third-party networks (Bitcoin, Namecoin, Blockstack), which goes against the \"works without internet\" purpose of ZeroNet.
