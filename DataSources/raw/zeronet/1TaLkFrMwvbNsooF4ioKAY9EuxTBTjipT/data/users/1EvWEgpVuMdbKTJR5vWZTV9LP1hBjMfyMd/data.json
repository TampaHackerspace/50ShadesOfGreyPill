				"body": "> One possible solution would be to create a support group which is about \"Helping people to deal with sexual disorders\", so the group may have much larger audience and support from the community, than you support something which is illegal (which is totally valid, nobody wants their children to be hurt physically / emotionally).\n\nThing is, I don't see many paraphiliae - beside paedophilia - which would be considered \"disorders\" nowadays, at least in our so-called \"western world\".\n\nNow, on the subject of pedophiles, I'd like to say a word, as a father myself. Whoever touches my kids is probably going to die a rather gruesome, lengthy and unpleasant death. This put aside, I don't care that much what people _like_ - even if it's children - as long as they've got enough discipline not to take any chances to cross the line between \"thoughts\" and \"acts\". I wouldn't like to live in a society where people are going to jail because of what they think. Even if what they think is involves children, is rather unspeakable, and leaves me quite uneasy (to say the least).\n\nTo put it shortly : I don't care about pedophiles, as long as they don't get too close to kids (esp. mine).\n\nAnd, in a way, I do think - maybe like the OP - that a pedophile who's working hard to stay \"clean\" could use some support.",
