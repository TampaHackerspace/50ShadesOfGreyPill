			"body": "I just had a minimal chat on IRC with Erkan Yƒ±lmaz, the guy behind all things ZeroVerse (e.g., ZeroVerse Mail and ID), and he told me that he is not using ZeroNet anymore. Around three months ago Erkan became very silent, but I hoped he had just gone to spend the summer in Turkey, or something. Instead it turns out he dropped out of ZeroNet. It's somewhat unfortunate, partly because some people were/are using his ZeroVerse ID+Mail services, partly because Erkan has squatted _a lot_ of zero*.bit domains, and of course also because Erkan had many good intentions for ZeroNet.\nWell, we can't force people how to spend their energy, so instead of moaning the fact that Erkan has left ZeroNet, let's try to be practical. I, for one, will stop seeding all of Erkan's zites and stop using ZeroVerse Mail+ID. I suggest you guys do the same. Erkan might donate his lot of .bit domains to someone, but I'm not going to hold my breath. If he doesn't (and if he doesn't choose to renew the registration) they'll expire in about 84 days and will be up for the grabs.\n\n/me hops off soapbox",
