				"body": "Torrents don't work over Tor because you have to announce a real IP address in order for the rest of the swarm to communicate with you.  Torrent traffic also involves many, many connections, which would put a heavy burden on the Tor network.\n\nThe best option is probably to find a VPN you can trust not to give up your information.  However, these have subscription costs and there is probably no basis for trust unless you know the operators.\n\nA seedbox can handle all the torrent activity and then serve files at your convenience.  The trust issue remains, although maybe you could download your local copy through Tor.  [ZeroMail 2.0](http://127.0.0.1:43110/16X3emHaVgNPrx39U1sYd24dFk5L5swTua/) has a rudimentary file sharing service which seems to be ineffective for large transfers.\n\nYou can likely avoid interference just by requiring encryption on all your torrent connections.  If this were clearnet, [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) could help to prevent your ISP from seeing DNS requests for torrent sites.  (An alternate DNS might still help with some torrent client configurations.)\n\nThe current Play site makes me very uneasy: its listings mix http links to imdb with unidentified media links to unknown content from an unknown host.  I can't see immediately that it links to ZeroNet at all.  It has no magnet links, which could be used anonymously.

Currently what we get with Zeromail is more a messenging Bitmessage like app. Zeromail 2.0 adds the possibility to share a file but it has never worked with me so far. It has to be a real replacement for Outlook otherwise it's going to be difficult to get people to adopt a decentralized emailing system.\n\nZeroMail 2 and [NullFolder](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GrtBsG57kjU2Z3iAQebG9D5c8CRDRLoPj/) use webtorrent, which uses WebRTC to transfer files from one browser window to another.  It stops working if the sender closes their window or even refreshes the page.  Coming from ZeroMail, one probably expects that the file sharing would store files in the same way that messages are stored.  It might be easier to create a new site to host your file than to arrange for both participants to be available [at the same time](http://xkcd.com/921/).",
