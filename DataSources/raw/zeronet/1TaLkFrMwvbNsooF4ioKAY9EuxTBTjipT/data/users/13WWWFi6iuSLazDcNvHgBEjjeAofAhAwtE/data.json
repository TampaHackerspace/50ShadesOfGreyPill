I'm planning to have a separate unit with a 3TB hard drive just for ZeroNet that I can access on the LAN so it can be up all the time and not interfering with the work on the actual machine.",

This sounds great until users legitimately reach this limit and cannot post anymore. This is a problem that needs to be overcome one way or another.\n\nI fail to see how it can prevent spam. If someone uses a bot to spam on the network, they also can program it to change the size limit.",
