These files weight a couple of KB at maximum, and every site having its own JQuery has an advantage: decentralisation. What happens if the owner of a CDN modifies the file ? Everybody using that CDN will be doomed.\n\nGood point, although a couple KB at maximum is a definite understatement. jQuery 2.1 is 83kb minimized.",
