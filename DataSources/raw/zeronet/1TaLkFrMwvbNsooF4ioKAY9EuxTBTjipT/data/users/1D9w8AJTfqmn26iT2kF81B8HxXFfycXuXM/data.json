Not exerting it by delegating it. \n> In the primitive tribe, everything was immanent, so there was no need for complex mechanisms.\n> However, today, our societies are indeed more complex. \n> Thus the closest organization to immanent power over our lives, were all the people exert power, is direct democracy. In the internet era, it's possible. The citizens should be able to write the law, discuss it,  and vote it. \n> Executive power (government) should be, in an ideal system,  randomly drawn among the citizens.\n> Since it's not realistic in today society to randomly drawn executives, they should at least be all elected, and the people should have the power to remove then from their functions at any time without any motives. Real power over the representative. If they act badly, they shouldn't be immune (like G.W Bush), but the people should be able to judge them, and punish them if necessary.\n> No, we do not all want our leader. And i feel their is a trend, (mostly on the internet but heh aren't we all geeks and tomorrow society), more and more people believe all these presidential elections in the west are jokes. Bad theater. And they want an other political system.\n\nAbsolutely right comrade!.   Also Anarcho_capitalsim is an oxymoron, its grammatically nonsensical as much as philosophically so.   Debt the first 5000 years (David Graeber) is full of examples of how anarchy worked for us.  It only went pair shaped when we introduced the notion of debt and credit. War and slavery ensued.

You cannot make co-exist anarchism and money, -which is fungible power over others, seriously accentuates greed, and end up like virtual chains: debt (usury, and disguised usury if you forbid usury).\n> Anarcho-communism seems fashionable these days, and it seduce people who think the money-game got corrupted. But here is were they are wrong: the money-game didn't get corrupted: it is a corrupting game.\n> When money was introduced, humans got sick.\n> However, we shouldn't antagonize anarcho capitalists. Most are good guys and just want a better live for them and the others. And the system just want that: horizontal struggle. \n> It will take time, but they'll understand that you cannot control money. In the end, money always controls you.\nthe money-game didn't get corrupted: it is a corrupting game.\nConversely, anarchy isnt a political idea , its humans natural state. Its innate.   Ever passed someone the salt at the dinner table without asking 'what's in it for me'? That's anarchy.  Its not even radical, it just seems it bacuase we've been indoctrinated by capitalism and 'debts to man' for centuries.  I am sure you know all this, its for the benefit of others here -  it amazes me anacho-capitalists  don't understand even the basics of what anarchy is.  I expect it from capitalists, but to be an anarcho capitalist you surely have to have studied the anarcho part a bit?!!",

These are major shareholders, property owners, and even the owner of a small business.\n> Second, the working-class. Those sell their working abilities and their time in exchange of a salary to the owners of the means of production. Of course, they are paid less than the wealth their labor creates. An they are proportionnally far less paid today than a century ago for a particular amount of work. The wages didn't follow the increase of production due to mechanization. Thus, they are, and it's not subjective, but mathematical, more exploited today than in the past.\n> Anarcho capitalism want to perpetrate this separation of humans in 2 classes.\n> Even if their system work (which i seriously doubt), there could be less ultra rich, and also less poor, but the separation will stay.\n> In the primitive tribe, there is no separation. They aren't 2, or many, but one.\n> Anarcho-capitalism is the state of society when it is somewhere between a sharing society (primitive tribe) and a modern capitalistic state. It only last during the transition from sharing society to modern capitalistic state. And even during this short period, life is far from being perfect: there is necessarily tensions created by money and private property of the means of production.\n> Since it seem to be the subject, i'll give an example. During the end of the 19th century, there were many independent oil producers in the old west. This, for anarcho-capitalist, represent a regretted dream, which they want to make today reality again.Do you know what happened in this (supposedly), dreamed, competitive economy?\n> Rockefeller bought all the little independant exploitation. Threatened to lower the prices (because he was in control of the majority of oil and thrusts make economy of scale). For those little oil drill owners who didn't want to sell, Rockefeller just hired thugs to break their bones. After that, they sold their little exploitation.This is how anarcho-capitalism end. Being absorbed by thrusts which crush them because a big company has far less daily expenses proportionnally to their sizes than small companies. A small company use many of it's ressource just to function day after day. A giant company use less, thus it's far more competitive. An economy of small companies in competition could just not function. The bigger would absorb them all an become a giant.\n> That's why mustn't rearrange the mode of production once again. We must change our mode of production. Create a new mode of production. A money-less mode of production. A classless society.\n\nExcellent points. \n\n> In the primitive tribe, there is no separation. They aren't 2, or many, but one.  \n\nor  'Just as no one has the right to  tell us our true value, no one has the right to tell us what we truly \nowe.'   \n\nDebt (and all money IS debt)   is just the  perversion  of a  promise.  It is a  promise  corrupted  by  both  math  and  violence.  If freedom  (real  freedom)  is  the  ability  to  make  friends,  then  it is also,  necessarily,  the  ability  to  make  real  promises.  What  sorts  of promises  might  genuinely  free  men  and  women  make  to  one  another?\n\nThis is the question all of us should ask every day.   Debt is a social construct, there is no innate moral justification  to pay a debt.   Anarchy is simply the rejection of debt and the rejection of violent enforcement of debt.",

For attacks from without, look at Russia for example, during the Russian civil war all the big world powers jumped in to help the white army. For attacks from within, look at Khrushchev and Gorbachev.\n\nBut what you advocate here is continuing violence until you reach a perfect class free state (then non-state).  Anarchists use violence only to defend their possessions and freedoms.   Rose Theory.  You must understand the difference between possession vs private property.   But also anarchists don't need to create a perfect world or state (or one state).  It is a voluntary association, the only demend that they as individuals anmd voluntary collectives be free from the interference by others.  In other words, anachy can (and does) exist within an oppressive state.  Anarchy can work anytime any place.",

Nobody in the world wants to have half or more of their day's labour to make up the profits of a capitalist. The vast majority want this money to help provide things like healthcare, housing and so on. The vast majority do want this. Unfortunately, many of them are absorbed in moralising, ie \"one person dying is one too many... therefore a revolution is off the table\", meanwhile people alienated by capitalism are dying all the time, worldwide.\n> As a Marxist-Leninist, I say if the bourgeoisie are willing to give up control of the state (they currently have a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, where all the state apparatus is there to serve capitalists ie courts that are expensive, or police vans parked near big shopping malls) then we would peacefully take over and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, or a state that is set up in the interest of workers (free/cheap housing, cheap transport, free healthcare etc).

I could hold a gun to your head and told you to dance like a chicken, you'd do so if you wanted to live. Because of the Sun's gravity the Earth is compelled to orbit the Sun. In the stage of socialism, yes there will be coercion against bourgeois forces who try to undermine the proletarian state. The point is to shape society so that you are just left with one, working class. A state is a tool for one class to hold power over the other, with only one class there is nobody to hold power over and therefore the state would stop existing.\n\nwith only one class there is nobody to hold power over and therefore the state would stop existing.\n\nBut whoever runs the state is not the person being run by the state.

				"body": "> [binero](#comment_64_17ac9ybVj5CtUpBvi5NeP1EwNZjfJoZWvt): I have read a large chunk on one of the links. I don't think I can answer you now. I do think now that anarchy indeed is better for most people, I still do not think it's reachable at least not yet. I do now even more rigurously disagree that anarchy is fit for me however. A system where there is no clear law nor any objective courtsystem is a system I cannot live in.\n\n'A study by the Common Cause Foundation, due to be published next month, reveals two transformative findings. The first is that a large majority of the 1,000 people they surveyed – 74% – identifies more strongly with unselfish values than with selfish values. This means that they are more interested in helpfulness, honesty, forgiveness and justice than in money, fame, status and power. The second is that a similar majority – 78% – believes others to be more selfish than they really are. In other words, we have made a terrible mistake about other people’s minds.\nWhatever happened to trust?\n\nA review article in the journal Frontiers in Psychology points out that our behaviour towards unrelated members of our species is “spectacularly unusual when compared to other animals”. While chimpanzees might share food with members of their own group, though usually only after being plagued by aggressive begging, they tend to react violently towards strangers. Chimpanzees, the authors note, behave more like the homo economicus of neoliberal mythology than people do.\n\nHumans, by contrast, are ultrasocial: possessed of an enhanced capacity for empathy, an unparalleled sensitivity to the needs of others, a unique level of concern about their welfare, and an ability to create moral norms that generalise and enforce these tendencies.\n\n The media worships wealth and power, and sometimes launches furious attacks on people who behave altruistically\n\nSuch traits emerge so early in our lives that they appear to be innate. In other words, it seems that we have evolved to be this way. By the age of 14 months, children begin to help each other, for example by handing over objects another child can’t reach. By the time they are two, they start sharing things they value. By the age of three, they start to protest against other people’s violation of moral norms.\n\nA fascinating paper in the journal Infancy reveals that reward has nothing to do with it. Three- to five-year-olds are less likely to help someone a second time if they have been rewarded for doing it the first time. In other words, extrinsic rewards appear to undermine the intrinsic desire to help. (Parents, economists and government ministers, please note.) The study also discovered that children of this age are more inclined to help people if they perceive them to be suffering, and that they want to see someone helped whether or not they do it themselves. This suggests that they are motivated by a genuine concern for other people’s welfare, rather than by a desire to look good.\n\nWhy? How would the hard logic of evolution produce such outcomes? This is the subject of heated debate. One school of thought contends that altruism is a logical response to living in small groups of closely related people, and evolution has failed to catch up with the fact that we now live in large groups, mostly composed of strangers.\n\nAnother argues that large groups containing high numbers of altruists will outcompete large groups which contain high numbers of selfish people. A third hypothesis insists that a tendency towards collaboration enhances your own survival, regardless of the group in which you might find yourself. Whatever the mechanism might be, the outcome should be a cause of celebration.\n\n\nSo why do we retain such a dim view of human nature? Partly, perhaps, for historical reasons. Philosophers from Hobbes to Rousseau, Malthus to Schopenhauer, whose understanding of human evolution was limited to the Book of Genesis, produced persuasive, influential and catastrophically mistaken accounts of “the state of nature” (our innate, ancestral characteristics). Their speculations on this subject should long ago have been parked on a high shelf marked “historical curiosities”. But somehow they still seem to exert a grip on our minds.\n\nAnother problem is that – almost by definition – many of those who dominate public life have a peculiar fixation on fame, money and power. Their extreme self-centredness places them in a small minority, but, because we see them everywhere, we assume that they are representative of humanity.\n\nThe media worships wealth and power, and sometimes launches furious attacks on people who behave altruistically. In the Daily Mail last month, Richard Littlejohn described Yvette Cooper’s decision to open her home to refugees as proof that “noisy emoting has replaced quiet intelligence” (quiet intelligence being one of his defining qualities). “It’s all about political opportunism and humanitarian posturing,” he theorised, before boasting that he doesn’t “give a damn” about the suffering of people fleeing Syria. I note with interest the platform given to people who speak and write as if they are psychopaths.\n\n\nThe effects of an undue pessimism about human nature are momentous. As the foundation’s survey and interviews reveal, those who have the bleakest view of humanity are the least likely to vote. What’s the point, they reason, if everyone else votes only in their own selfish interests? Interestingly, and alarmingly for people of my political persuasion, it also discovered that liberals tend to possess a dimmer view of other people than conservatives do. Do you want to grow the electorate? Do you want progressive politics to flourish? Then spread the word that other people are broadly well-intentioned.\n\nMisanthropy grants a free pass to the grasping, power-mad minority who tend to dominate our political systems. If only we knew how unusual they are, we might be more inclined to shun them and seek better leaders. It contributes to the real danger we confront: not a general selfishness, but a general passivity. Billions of decent people tut and shake their heads as the world burns, immobilised by the conviction that no one else cares.\n\nYou are not alone.

Free speech is a right, censoring would be the opposite, but lately the term has been misused a lot, for example when people compared youtube not giving adsense to controversial videos to censorship.Of course deleting comments from a forum is not censorship, you have the right to free speech, but nobody is required to give you a platform to do so. Zeronet and other decentralized systems are a platform from everyone for everyone for free speech\n\nIts complicated when media companies dominate the internet.  Facebook is like an internet in itself.  Sure people can walk away from it, but in essence they control the content people see.  So sometimes the lack of censorphip (not taming the loudest voices with the most money)  can in itself be censorship of the quietest voices.  Structural violence, like copyright, is a form of censorship.  But few people, many liberal minded free speech advocates included,  complain about that.  There is a lot of cognitive dissonance around censorship mostly because it also applies to democracy.  Democracy and free speech only exists where everyone  truly has an equal platform to speak,  propose or share ideas, words and media.    I don’t think ads or are particularly a form of free speech, they are spaces bought and sold by the highest bidder, a form of mind rape, because many of them we cant avoid (walking down a street or waiting at a bus stop for example).  But others would argue blocking them is blocking free speech.   Free speech, like democracy can only exist in anarchist societies.

The abhorrent Investigatory Powers Bill in the UK has just been made law.  It allows Govt. to legally hack (HACK!)  anyone’s computer or phone. It allows monitoring of peoples internet usage (including by police) without warrant or even suspicion of a crime.   This is  rotten (and in  my view even worse than Brexit or Trump being elected) - Snowden describes at as the most draconian spying law of any country in the western world, including the US.   But what worries me most isnt the spying or security risk of backdoors etc being put in by google apple et. al. its the fear.  If people think this is happening thats all that really matters .  The idea that anyhing you say or read may be taken out of context or seen as controversial or criminal or be seen by police or civil servants (some who may be family members) stops you even risking discussion, or reading around controversial subjects and ultimately thinking.   Studies have shown that the wikipedia search for words like terrorism or  Shia  and Sunnis has significantly declined since the Snowden NSA papers were released.    As far as the state is concerned ramping up this fear by legalising and far surpassing what the NSA/GCHQ was already doing behind our backs is a win win in silencing the public and decent.   A truly terrifying world we now live in.   Decentralised networks and annonymity  tools like tor are utterly vital for the future of humanity.  Without them, there really is a risk of serious dumbing down and subduing  all of society, and once this fear and censorship has started , our collective knowledge and understanding gets less and less until we can no longer think for ourselves, about how to escape the world we will find ourselves in.  And there will be no going back - there may not even be the knowledge to have a violent revolution.  And worse of all the state wont actually need to monitor us much in reality. We will be fearfully and obediently censoring ourselves.  I'm already slightly more fearful  about discussing anarchy as a legitimate  idea.

In essence, it works for the parliament and for the council. If it doesn't do its job, it can be gotten rid of. I don't think the issue lies with the fact the comission isn't directly elected but rather that the Parliament actually needs to demand the comission to propose laws. I don't think the Comission should be the middle man here. It's still a lot better than pre-Lisbon however, as now at least the parliament can demand proposals. \n> I don't think the issue is because the capital owns the media. I think the issue lies with the people. Who honestly cares about what type of democracy we have? A lot of people if not most people do not. A significant portion of people here do not know who won the election, even though they voted! We do not have an absurd system here where you can buy advertisements. Political candidates, their parties and anyone supporting them is prohibited from advertising. All exposure the candidates get is from policy proposals. Even so, people still don't care. \n> Not everyone cares, and that's why I'm a supporter of your 'liquid' democracy, as in such a system everyone is allowed to care, but not everyone has to.\n\nThe state opposes democracy. Corporations oppose democracy. The media opposes democracy. So they invented representational democracy. And now the people oppose democracy too. Democracy was portrayed as something for bomb throwing violent 'anarchists (tm)' . Direct (or delegated) democracy can happen only in anarchist societies. And no capitalist system would even allow the people to contemplate it. Like Osama Bin Laden, if socialism didn't exist capitalism would have to invent it. They need to frame every system around the idea of a state. They need an opposition that frames society around a state to bolster and reinforce the idea in publics mind that representational democracy is the only system possible.

They only relate in the way that a communism is the economic system modelled after socialism.\n\nGeorge Orwell, who's writings are celebrated worldwide in capitalist nations, including in British schools, is known for disliking the communist state (Stalinist or otherwise - he also despised capitalism, though often it was never emphasised in school).  But whats more interesting is what we don't discuss and arent taught and what a lot of  people don't know:   he fought in Catalonia, with the POUM (The Workers' Party of Marxist Unification) - it was this experience inspired his famous anti-statist books (1984, Animal a farm).  He had a lot of good, inspiring and fascinating things to say about the anarchists in Catalonia (in Homage to Catalonia) , he fought alongside the anarchist militias against Franco,  and later concluded \"If I had understood the situation a bit better I should probably have joined the Anarchists.\"\n\nhe notes: \n\n \"I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites.\"\n\n\"Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Senor' or 'Don' or even 'Usted'; everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' and 'Thou,' and said 'Salud!' instead of 'Buenas Dias.' Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a lecture from a hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There were no private motor cars, they had all been commandeered, and alll the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night.\" ibid page 5\n\n\"Yet so far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful. There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine. In the barbers' shops were Anarchist notices (the barbers were mostly Anarchists) solemnly explaining that barbers were no longer slaves. In the streets were coloured posters appealing to prostitutes to stop being prostitutes.\" ibid page 6\n\n\"In practice the democratic 'revolutionary' type of discipline is more reliable than might be expected. In a workers's army discipline is theoretically voluntary. It is based on class-loyalty, whereas the discipline of a bourgeois conscript army is based ultimately on fear...In the militias the bullying and abuse that go on in an ordinary army would never have been tolerated for a moment.\"\n\n\"During the first two months of the war it was the Anarchists more than anyone else who had saved the situation, and much later than this the Anarchist militia, in spite of their indiscipline, were notoriously the best fighters among the purely Spanish forces.\"\n\n\"Many of the normal motives of civilized life-snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.-had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master.\n\n\" A British cruiser and two British destroyers had closed in upon the harbour, and no doubt there were other warships not far away. The English newspapers gave it out that these ships were proceeding to Barcelona 'to protect British interests,' but in fact they made no move to do so; that is, they did not land any men or take off any refugees. There can be no certainty about this, but it was at least inherently likely that the British Government, which had not raised a finger to save the Spanish Government from Franco, would intervene quickly enough to save it from its own working class.\"\n\nmore references here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1q7duh/orwell_on_anarchism/",

However, i just discovered Homage to Catalonia recently. \n> I think Homage to Catalonia is even more important than 1984, because it's not a fiction, but a biography of a period of Orwell's life. What's more it's a testimony, extremely well written (it's Orwell) of functional  anarcho-communism, not in the primitive tribe, but in modern era,  just 80 years ago.\n\nTotally agree!   All his works are brilliant, and im glad 1984/ AnFarm  are still taught in school.  But Homage has to be his most important.  It seems to have gone over the heads of the education systeml that he was anticapitalist, not just anti-stalinist , but anti-statist.  He was taught as an aid to teach us communism was bad .. But of course real communism has no state or leaders.  THAT was his point (not that capitalism is the solution) .   Like me he went through the minds of capitalist becoming marxist becoming anarchist.  But unlike me (mostly an armchair anarchist) , he was at the raw interface between them all, of really experiencing the fight, war and revolutions as they happening, he saw the results from all sides. \n\nI saw this on that site another quote;\n Mairin Mitchell's book Storm over Spain:\n\n\"Her book is valuable for a number of reasons, but especially because, unlike almost all English writers on Spain, she gives a fair deal to Spanish Anarchist. The Anarchists and Syndicalists have been persistently misrepresented in England, and the average English person still retains his eightneen-ninetyish notion that Anarchism is the same thing as anarchy. Anyone who wants to know what Spanish Anarchism stands for, and the remarkable things it achieved, especially in Catalonia, during the first two months of the revolution, should read chapter VII of Miss Mitchell's book.\" ibid pages 290-1\n \n\nI tried to find that book but its out of print (no suprise!) .

And this makes it impossible to talk without talking at cross purposes:  Anarchism and communism are the same thing, but either are not what you think they are:  or rather, this is a direct quote from wikipedia on the definition of COMMUNISM (its also in popular dictionaries) - note the crucial last word -  [absence of] the STATE :\n\nIn political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, \"common, universal\")[1][2] is the radical social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money,[3][4] and the state.[5][6]\nhttps://en.wikipedid the state.a.org/wiki/Communism\n\nIf you want to talk about stalinist communism thats fine, but please be clear about what you mean by 'bunch of communists', because the similarity between stalinist communists who support a state and anarchists is so near non-existent that anarchists sacrificed their lives fighting against them.

It leads to a society that knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing. \n\nHow much is a chicken worth?  (i can tell you its exactly £3.21 in my supermarket ).

So if I owe you money thats the price, no matter what its worth its the gun that decides what the price is, and its value fades in the face of a gun.  - just like Orwells doublespeak and doublethink : 'how many fingers am I holding up? *man holds up 5 fingers  pushes gun to his head* 'six' came the correct reply. \n",

Before, if you talked to me about what is communism, i'd have answered something like \"an ideology which killed dozens of millions of people\". However, in France, there is an extremely eloquent radical marxist named Francis Cousin which was invited to a webTv (metaTV), about 2 years ago.  Later he did other videos on youtube.He explained everything about the distinction between Bolchevism (Leninism, Trotstkyism), Stalinism, which were based on state coercion,  and radical marxism (which is anarcho-communism). \n> We need more people like him in each country native langage, in order for everybody to understand the difference between state capitalism (bolchevism) and radical marxism (anarcho-communism).\n\nAgree.  For contemporary anarchist, I always recommend David Graeber just  because he has a lot of video/audio works that seems to engage people more these days and his book on Debt is superb.   Occasionally he gets MSM attention for that too (he also coined the 99% vs 1% phrase) .   Noam Chomsky is great but can be a little dry for most people.  Few will venture or heard of the works by Emma Goldman, which is odd, given how much attention Emily Pankhurst gets in social history .   Goldman was way ahead of the game with the suffragette movement.",

And money was actually used 5000 years ago, it just wasn't printed money. It was rather food. The idea behind the invention of money is that a gold coin would be equivalent to one bread, so that way trading would be easier. The whole idea behind money is to represent value, and value of consumption and value of productions are two whole different ideas. Value is the value attributed to people to items, if to one's perspective chicken is worth 1$ and not 3.21$ in a supermarket, he can just wait for a price drop, or at least one could believe so.\n> And how the hell is capitalism backed by gun? Capitalism happens when mass production of goods begin, I am not an economist but capitalism has nothing to do with killing people. And if we needed to speak about people killed by capitalism, which is a number not even worth mentionning because it is non-existant, we could talk about the number of people killed by communism. Must be around an hundred millions, if not more. \n> And money-lending has nothing to do with capitalism and industrial production, banks existed way before the concept of capitalism even existed. You see, Karl Marx wholly misrepresented capitalism by making it look like if it was the \"bourgeois class owning the poor\", but capitalism is in fact mass production and sale (e.g. industrial production). That's why we call people like Henry Ford big capitalists, by the way. \n> However, big bankers (the actual \"Bourgeois class\") would rather be people like the Rothschild, who were big war profiteers in fact. I don't recall Henry Ford or Walter Disney financing wars... Weird right? \n> The fact is that capitalism is not what marxists make it seem it is. Capitalism rewards hard work, while communism, and especially marxist anarchism would reward no one, as each would be rewarded equally. This would ensure mass lazyness, and in the past it certainly did.\n> Money-lending is not capitalism, and that is a fact. Banks are certainly profiting from mass consumption, but the mass moneylending we see now is slowly being replaced by safer, less fluctuating alternatives like Ether based ones, and I don't see banks surviving in a few hundred years. But anyways, if your complain about capitalism is that it is state coercion, you couldn't be more wrong. Capitalism has nothing to do about state coercion, it is just an economic model. Capitalism does not take your home from you or kill your dog for as far as I know, it just means that corporation compete with each others to make the best product possible. Money-lenders would do if you don't pay your debt, but if you're smart about money you wouldn't have to worry about that. \n> Capital is a word for object of value, capitalism is the mass production of objects of value.\n\nMoney is backed by guns.  When I say money, I mean coinage.  Eg the Dollar $ .  Coins were invented to pay the army.  If you don't pay a debt with the correct currency (which you MUST earn) you will be hurt with violence.  This is aas true today as its always been.  I call this Structural Violence.  If you always pay, you dont see violence, but the reason you pay, ultimately is because you will be subject to violence.  Try it.  See what happens when  you dont pay your restaurant bill, or your mortgage using the 'army approved' currency of the nation you live.  If you tried to use food to pay your bill it owuld be rejected.  And you will be arrested and subject to violence. So money isnt like you say it is.  But for sure I understand this simplification, its been said , wrongly, many times before.  Also barter existed after coinage, not before.  And if you can find a single archaeologist, historian or anthropologist who claims to have evidence to the contrary I will eat my cat.  But either way, you can test it yourself, a dollar is a specific trade in currency, you cant use anything to trade and you cant even barter.   Try it with your bank and see what happens. (not recommended if you value your life)",

But the very idea that a labour has any word, at all, is stupid. The product of the labour has worth, the labour itself is nothing. I am currently typing an argument on my keyboard, which could be called \"labour\", does it have any worth? If it does, then the capitalist model in today's world would work very well to recompensated my arguments. Things like flattr permit to recompensate nearly everything one has done, and this model will soon move to cryptocurrencies, I believe. \n> Capitalists do not exploit others labour, they recompensate other for the production of a product that is not their original idea. Capitalism recompensate ideas, and those who help them achieve their ideas. If it was \"exploitation\", then you likely wouldn't be paid. Marx called the product of a labour \"labour-power\", and that it was the item they were selling. They are not selling anything at all, they're helping the capitalist (Industrial owner, if you didn't get it) product items. In today's society, this could include selling those items, shipping them, because the industries need money to function, money being a representation of their buying power. And they get recompensated for it.\n> If labour had any value at all, then all labour would be equally recompensated, but what constitute labour and what doesn't couldn't be determined by Marx, and all Marx has achieved with his opposition to capital was the creation  of totalitarian states, which realized that money was necessary to represent the value of one's work and kept using money.\n> Don't try to tell me I'm oppressed by working, I am not. I am a working class person and I don't think there's any wrong with that.\n\nIm surprised you read the communist manifesto, because you don’t  seem to have bothered reading the capitalist ones (i dunno, Adam Smith or Ayan Rand some crap like that) .

Aphids are exploited by ants , but at no point does the aphid feel threatened or aware of this.  But mammals simply dont exploit this way.  Nor do even great apes.

Capitalism was born out of the invention of coinage by kings to pay armies and control the populus. Do you disputes this?  Lots of capitalists, nearly all historians and probably most economists agree this - its why we have the queens head on every note and coin in the UK . Coins were printed by the political class (and monarchs) for political purposes to build a political state to control the political narrative starting around 5000 years ago. The word politics comes from police (of people).  Politicsa is policing people by making them earn coins to pay taxes in coins created by the people doing the policing. Dont pay your tax you are subjected to violence in one form or another.      Money an invention of faith in a politcal system - you have to believe in the politics of those who print it (govnts/private banks) else money as coins/iou's/debt and to a lesser extent gold (as it has some intrinsic value unlike paper notes)  doesnt work at all.  We may not think about the armies collecting taxes anymore, its become a faith, a religion even, we put the violence out of our mind and follow the rules faithfully so we never get to find out - until you become dirt poor for whatever unfoirtunate reason, then you loose the faith.

The second question is  to ask is  did any other political system do anything to prevent it?  The third is: Could they have?\n\nIf they were clinical psycopaths then there really is very little we can do about that.  If they arent then we must ask about their cultural upbringing, what made them violent.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves, does  state violence and oppresion make people violent? Their paarents?  Where the parents abused by the state? Oppression breeds oppression.  We have to ask these questions.\n\nThere is a good story here about a UK cop who realised his effort to prevent crime as a cop he actually caused much worse crimes where other innocent victims were subject  to  extreme violence and rape because of his actions (not his intention).   \n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/neil-woods-undercover-cop-who-abandoned-the-war-on-drugs\n\n\n\n I think we have to understand that society is responsible for each other.  It cannot be left to one authority.  Its much more complex.  But in short without writing an essay, I think its because we live in a world which has taught us to fear love.  To love others less.  And look after only ones selfish interests.   Humans actually find this hard.  But capitalism and its proponents work hard to tell us to work hard and reject others in the pursuit of our own ideals.  To leave all matters to the state.  We tend towards anarchy.  We are social paternal animals who instantly want to nurture babies and co-operate with people.  Its what we are best at.  The capitalist have to use fear and  violence constantly to stop us caring for each other.  Because if we care for each other they don’t get what they want.  Indecently, I think the capitalists , ie the true powers, and rulers of the world (most those members of the bilderberg group) really are clinical psychopaths. They also exploit our innate desire to co-operate making us believe in their ideology.   It doesnt take many of these types  to seize power and turn the world and humanity into slaves and brutes.  History has shown us many of these characters pop up over and over.  Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler.     I  remember reading about a study some time ago showing many banker CEOs  showed strong clinical psychopathic traits.  It only takes one or 2 to bring down the entire global economy.

It's pretty obvious, and there has never been so many crazies since we entered the capitalistic era.The recent John Podesta affair illustrates it.\n\nIndeed.  2.2 million (2,220,300) people are in prison in the US. and a futher 4.5 million ( 4,751,400) are on parole in the US (in 2013).  Does that sound like a functional society?  Thats a huge amount of the population. Either they have all gone crazy or the people deciding what is good behaviour are crazy  .  Either way it shows how fucked up capitalist society really is.  Its an embarrassment to humanity that so many people are in prison in the richest country in the world.  And with the US being the biggest capitalist society on earth ,  it has to be the most damning indictment of both capitalism and state control if ever there was one.   The US also has more people in prison PER CAPITA than any other country in the world (the UK is 3rd).

I have something that I made my self from materials I gather my self. Would it be ok for me to become rich? If no, what could you do to prevent it?\n\nHow would you get rich by doing that.  Unless you had money.  Whos going to make money and print it and regulate it?   you?   I'd laugh at you.  Then i'd go and collect my own wood, make a machine and give it to anyone I'd like to see make use of it. \n\n> Taking the it one step further. What if I needed more people and we shared it 80/20. This person would still become tremendously wealthy. Would it be ok even if it was unequal? After all, it was I that built the machine.\n\nYou can't think of a world without money.  Money is a faith, a religion, a hypothetical and EXTREMELY MODERN intangible invention.    You are a human being, get out and stop thinkign about money.  Share , create, give and contribute.  Stop thinking of your enviroment and others  in terms of their worth and profit.  \n\nAn anarchist looks at someone elses mantelpiece,  wonders from the objects what kind of person they might be.

You are uncapable of doing rational conclusions. All the problems you listed are a result of states, not free-markets. If you are in a contract that is not beneficial to you, then you are by definition stupid.\n\nLook I agree there can be a free market without the state -  but only under anarchy! I want that! . There  is no free market under capitalism.  Not in all of history.  Again if you can name a capitalist free market (one that makes profit) that doesnt have state interference I'll send you all my bitcoins.   Of course the capitalists love the state, it does their dirty work of collecting debt.   The only bit they don't like is being taxed by them (this is done to assuage voters the state is looking out for their interests, thus ensuring periodic votes for the status quo without civil war).  For as long as the people are sedated and exploited libertarianism isn’t necessary. When they arent, the capitalists will immediately destroy the 'democratic' state  and start their own fascist regime and people like you will call it libertarianism and freedom (because you just want a piece of the money pie).  And probably civil war will ensue\n\n> No, gold, silver and rear earth metals are not backed by governments. They are used by governments, but not backed. Often in a business situation you pay up front. At least in part. By paying parts both parties take risk. But in the long run it's in both interests to be trust worthy. I wouldn't know about Smith, but I know Rothbard would disagree.\n\nUm yes they are, most of the worlds gold reserves are owned in vaults  by govnts and banks (with  security guards stood round with guns).  Still I agree that gold is better than money.  It is more fungible - it can be spent anywhere.  Bitcoins are way better.   Im not against money.  Im against debt.  Most of the us dollars and british pounds in the world are backed only by debts, created out of thin air. Backed by nothing but state violence.\n\nCurious , who do you not think is an idiot (apart from yourself)?",

I've been using linux exclusiveley since the nineties and was a linux evangelist for a decade. The only reason why Linux is so tremendously popular is because it was licenced under GPL. If he had been greedy it wouldn't have been a success. So I don't acknowledge that. As for Cohen, I wouldn't know, but I wouldn't automatically assume that to be true for him either.\n\nWell this is probably true.  Which all goes to show things work better without profiteering from it.  Thats a classic own goal:   Linux /  BitTorrent was a success because it rejected capitalism.

But as it stands, there is more than enough to go around.   We just don't want to share it.  And raising the standard of living for people reduces population growth.

One thing I'm experimenting with now is simulating small (100-200 person) communities to see if it's possible to sustain the good things of modern life in community sizes that are compatible with the limits of human compassion.\n> The idea comes from observing and spending time with members of a nearby, successful, contemporary near-anarchist community: the Amish.\n> The Amish deliberately limit community size to about 150 people.  This happens to agree with research that people are capable of maintaining meaningful relationships with about the same number.  When an Amish community grows beyond this size, they send a group of members off to create a new one.  They stay connected (to the extent that they are connected to any other Amish community), but they are each separate autonomous communities.\n> My work is focused on determining if this (along with some other principles) could be applied to communities that don't have all the restrictions the Amish place on themselves.  I've been studying them and other similar communities and so far I don't see a reason to believe it's not possible.  Now I'm working on software simulations that will help me test these ideas and understand where they need to be tweaked or improved before involving groups of people IRL.\n\nThis is an interesting study.   I'm curious, as anarchy can only work well if anarchists have nomadic access to many resources (and arent under constant oppresion by capitalist property laws).   Will that be possible to simulate IRL?    I think the Catalonian anarchists did well precisely because their group was larger -  so their access to land and resources was wide .   But of course that was in the face of external oppression.  Federated small anarchist groups, free from external tyranny,  may work much better still.  But where do you test that?",

I believe almost everyone will be provided for, and the consumerism we see today will fade away. Eventually people will have everything they need. People have for instance almost stopped purchasing new computers because they last so long and most people don't generally need more computing power. Only a few groups of people need state of the art. When people no longer have to buy stuff, they can work less and spend more time with their family.

At first it'll use shares and a currency, at first...\n\nThis is all very interesting.  And raises a lot of questions.  Its fascinating and mindbogglingly complex (which I like) - Just the thinking about DAOs allows us to consider what contracts/debt/money etc really are - if it makes us think about them and their relationship with humanity it is no bad thing.  We just accept 'contracts' (eg debts)  at face value (also see  jubileedebt.org.uk ;) and who enforces these and under what authority eludes most people when you ask them.  But with blockchain contracts Ive always been deeply cynical of the outcome should such things start to take off as a solution to this -it may hide it even more.   Also to my mind DAOs are only as good as the interface between the blockchain and the mechanics of real life.   Sure you could create contracts that automatically set of a series of blockchain (contractual) events when you spend money to a particular DAO address , and maybe that makes some uber car automatically turn up and drive  you to the pub.  But the locking mechanism on the car doesnt run in in the mathematically  perfect binary manner of a million decentralised intel processors telling it to do so.  Its not just humans who disobey financial contracts (which this solves) but machines:  Ever put a coin in a vending machine and have it swallow it?    Its 2017 (that IS the future in my 40 yr old head). That problem still hasn’t been fixed.  I can't even shutdown my computer properly most times:  I curse  PC manufacturers who took away the reset button from the PC box  because 'windows should be shut down properly with the software'.    When that software fails, and it does, you still have to hard reset.   Just because you shouldn’t doesnt mean you wont have to.   - gone off on a tangent there , sorry - I get that these contracts mean nobody is enforcing anything except the computer - an unpaid debt will be paid automatically by the blockchain and no state or judge needs to force it.   But when that causes human catastrophe and  there's no human accountability, it just normalises our alienation from each other and every broken promise/contract becomes unforgivable no matter what.   And nobody is accountable to anyone.  It just replaces structural state violence with interpersonal violence.   At the end of that path, among the chaos and years  of alienation from our human nature, our capacity for forgiveness and infinate love, we may just wonder why have contracts at all, why not just steal what you need from everyone, fuck the system,  after all nobody is worth anything in human /spiritual terms , the blockchain says so..  And if thats a possibility who will police it?  Blockchian authored robots with guns?  What then, we become machines, and behave like machines, unthinking, obedient ,  joyless, loveless machines in a binary system of codes, switches, leavers and repeating sequences.  What becomes the purpose of life?.   No thanks I think I'd prefer real police and real judges fucking me over all day, even hatred is better than the empty sound of a contractual obligation.  Its bad enough dealing with my telecoms company on the phone even when they do use actual humans.. \n\nHaving said that, I can see it has uses, rather like the internet and bitcoin itself.   But as with all technologies, and the reason we aren’t all working 15 hour weeks, it wont work if its built on the foundation and spirit of capitalism.   It doesnt address the systemic problems with the culture of capitalism and contractual obligations .  It could be come a living hell.  I’m not sure what use an-coms would have for it?  What am I missing.   Can you see a good future in this for an-coms (if we somehow got rid of the capitalist culture)?  When it comes to technologies, we can talk all we like about what  we CAN use it for,  and it doesn't matter even if we can be sure it could make world peace, because we always forget to ask what WILL we use it for.  (technologies should make most work today almost redundant -it really could - but it doesn’t because that isn’t what the capitalists want)    When we invented nuclear fusion, the first thing we thought was 'ooh thats an incredible feat of engineering, now how can we threaten and kill people with it?' \n\nAs you said to Warlock earlier, I think we have to look backwards, before we can move forward.   Capitalism is beyond reform.  We need to get in touch with our innate humanity, and then decide what we can do with all this great technology.    Rather than invent all this great technology and then decide what we are going to do with it.\n",

I'd argue that you can't be a true anarchist if you support a society that has money and ownership.\n\nWell, as I say it depends what you mean by money. Money is just an I O U a favour. Money is a token of trust. It can be anything. Modern currency is not money, its violence and debt. (although I should have said money not currency which is different. In that case you are correct) Money is not always about ownership. Anarchist David Graeber writes a fascinating account of gift economies vs human economies, in his book Debt: the first 5000 years. The definition of money is very complex.  Coinage and profit is inherently anti anarchist.  But exchanging one thing for another thing so you can exchange it for something else at a later date (money) isnt inherently anti-anarchist.    The thing with bitcoin is that, at the moment, it isnt backed by state violence.  Its problem is that it can still be used for hording profits, but so can a bag of grain.  Its all about how we value contracts.  And how we think of them.  Some people see wealth some people see goods they can distribute to the community.",

Fully developed usually means 'richer'.  But India is technically the 7th richest country in the world.  But MOST people there are very very poor.   This is because of inequality.  In china the elderly, non breeding populations are left in rural areas. The young move to the cities.  This reduces population.  Makes some richer, but creates extreme poverty in the rural areas.   Africa is quite differnt.  But what they all have in common is that extreme poverty is increasing even as overall wealth is increasing.   Equality (of access to resources ) reduces population more than wealth. \n\nChina gets richer but more unequal:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/28/china-more-unequal-richer\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/china-rural-poor-left-stranded\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/30/the-worlds-poorest-50-are-a-trillion-dollars-worse-off-whats-going-on\n\nAmerica is not much different in many ways.  The richest country in the world, but has much more poverty per capita than most poorer western european nations.  (although the UK is only just ahead).   Access to education is key to population slowing.   Most western nations have good education (relative to third world countries) so populations are slowing  generally.  But this doesnt solve inequality.",

And if you own something, you need to enforce that ownership and restrict others' access to it. While that can certainly happen in an anarchy, it's not supportive of such and does not match the ideals, philosophy, etc. And I'd argue that in a properly formed anarchy, it'd be unneeded entirely and there'd be no reason to do so.\n> \nYes we cannot have ownership or property.    But if I send you, a distant comrade a letter asking for food because my child is sick, I should not offer gifts (gifts makes us slaves).  I have nothing to trade.  What I offer is my humanity and solidarity.  My word, a letter of love.   That is my money.   Everything is symbolic/gestures/tokens, language itself , before things can materialise.    Currency today I agree, it should be abolished.   But I also think there is a missunderstanding about that too. The point I wanted to make was really about profit, money (as in currency can exist without profit).  Its still a ransom to work, but profiit (like interest) was never always the result of money -  in middle eastern societies before capitalism, prices were determined buy the community, not the buyer or the seller.  And never for profit. \n\nQ) Should anarchists support bitcoin or decry it?\n\n\n> Indeed. I see that as what should be the 'goal' of current governments. Get rid of the opportunity to create income and wealth inequality, and then reduce ownership and switch to models of mutual access.\n> \nAgree\n> I'd be curious on how you can practice anarchism in modern society. It's not exactly like you can just ignore the legal system and assume nothing will go wrong. I do think opting out of society as much as possible should be the current goal. And focusing on making free decentralized systems so that the current legal and monetary systems are unneeded. The less support mainstream society has, the easier it'll be to get rid of it. I talked a bit about this on my blog, but I definitely need to do some more in-depth writing. Unfortunately I don't think opting out completely without societal support will ever be possible, as long as you have medical needs or desire new tech.\n> What we really need to get anarchism off the ground and going is lots of funding and resources. Building up networks of anarchist communities, and focusing on cutting ties with major systems. I think ZeroNet can be a key piece of this in terms of tech. No need for dedicated webhosts, no need for ICANN, no big corp tracking or spying, etc. Unfortunately the hardware and physical aspect of it all is much more difficult than the digital portion. Software is already an anarchy :)\n\nFunding?  By that I assume you mean 'stealing' (taking back what is ours to take), especially given your first comment about money ;)",

And the blockchain itself can be a useful way of assigning names and numbers (see namecoin which is great). I do not think access should be restricted based on bitcoin (or namecoin). I think a UBI implementation like duniter would be a better option to support, if you're looking to replace money but still keep it.\nSo you do think people should own names and web pages?  Namecoin IS money.   I agree we shouldnt own materials and have private property.  But I think you missunderstand my point.  UBI is a terrible idea because not only does it still allow the capitalists to control the means of production, it also doesnt give people the leverage of being able to withdraw their labour, and UBI could be cut back at the whim of the capitalists -  leaving many without any income or leverage to demand it back.   Its also why UBI is popular among the right wing capitalists as much as with the socialists.  Some corporate lobbyists are promoting UBI because its a distraction from the fact they own the property and means of production, it  grants them all the power of the state and resources and production in exchange for charity to the unemployed.    Duniter means you only get income if you own a computer and own/purchase coins.  Theres nothing remotely anarchist about that.  Its still designed to be exclusive only to people who have the means to access it.  It is libertarianism, which to my mind is the worse of all systems.  I appreciate the intent is good.  But capitalism cannot be reformed.  Its just another variant of socialism trying to slow the worse excesses of capitalism.  But it isnt going to lead to anarchy.  We need to reject ALL forms of capitalism. \n> \n> Ideally funding and resources would be obtained peacefully, rather than aggravating the rest of society. It's important to have a good image. There's also the issue of legal theft deprives someone else of their access. Which is anti-anarchistic. It would not be an issue in an anarchy, as the person 'deprived' could simply take it back, or take something else they need. But within current society, most people do not want to get on the bad side of the militarized police. You're free to do so, but I don't think that'll be the fastest way of demonstrating a minimal viable product. To properly kickstart an anarchy you'd need lots of resources. Land, some sort of farm for food production, technology, shelter, water, electricity, etc. The more the better. Imagine managing to make an anarchic city. Go anywhere in the city and it's still good.

It's important to have a good image. \nI totally disagree with this.  If we could have it peacefully we would have by now!   Maintaining an important image means not acting on what needs to be done .  Its the greatest barrier to anyone becoming an anarchists and precisely why the media paints activists as violent thugs rather than people with purpose and people of conscience.  If you destroy property of banks (who are theives) or fight fascist police it actually effects them and may actually help other comrades, but you will not paint a good image of yourself.  Even the socialists who try and give a good image of themselves (by simply holding political banners against fasism) are never portrayed well in the media.\n\n>.

You need to understand the black block movement.  Its a tactic for actually doing stuff that effects the system and allowing other protests (even non anarchists) to protest and act in other effectual ways whilst distracting the cops.    Do you think marching up and down a predetermined route helps?   The Womens March in DC last week was a distraction from the call for an actual womens global strike on that day  (which would have been way way more effective - revolutionary id say - see   http://www.womenstrike.org/  (the media didnt even acknowledge this call by women)    Thats why the media promoted the weekend march so much, to drown it out.   It does fuck all harm to them by comparison. And gives women an outlet that is mostly harmless to them.  Withdrawing labour is the only way to destroy capitalism.  Captalism will always exist while we still provide labour for them.  A weekend march doesnt touch them .  As a defiant act of self expression, it has some value (it potentially helps push the theory that we should change the system along a little).

On one hand, private ownership of a name/password/etc. is pretty much needed for online services to work and be convenient. On the other, owning a name or namecoin is indeed 'money' and thus enforced ownership. I think namecoin isn't really the way to go, even though it works much better than current DNS systems. I can see a type of namecoin blockchain popping up that has the UBI properties of duniter. Or maybe just ditching domain names altogether (though that might be difficult for non-tech people). As for web pages, yes. People should be free to be able to manage their own websites. Much like how it's done here on ZeroNet. You can easily clone a site, look at the source code, modify your locally downloaded copy, etc. So it's not like the content is 'owned'. And there'd certainly be no copyright. So really the only thing you could say is \"ownership of the ability to access content associated with a particular public key\". At which point I'd argue that it's not owned, but merely accessed by one person who's the only person who knows how to access it. If someone else got their hands on the private key, there'd be no issue with them modifying the site. Privacy =/= ownership. But this is certainly something I'd need to think more about, and talk about with other anarchists.\n\nAgree it is complicated.   ( I recommend anarchist David Graeber's book: Dept the first 5000 years which discusses the meaning of money at length)   Ive thought about this a lot and don't think its quite right to say anarchists must not use money.  Ownership of resources and private property is different to privacy and possessions. I think there are kinds of money that have a similar dichotomy of meaning that many anarchist fail to grasp. \n> \n> Oh I agree. I don't mean to say UBI is the end-all be-all system. I'm saying for transitional purposes, it's very useful. It helps remove the reliance on wage slavery. Again, refer to duniter for a good example of how I imagine a transitional currency.\n> \n> In duniter you don't 'purchase coins'. They're generated continuously and evenly distributed among the users. The inflation involved automatically equalizes older users and newer users, as well as the rich and poor. It's designed to be able to be used for transactions, while also keeping wealth and income equality over long periods of time. And yes, it's limited to people who have a computer and have opted-in, because this obviously isn't a government currency, and it's exclusively digital (like most money nowadays).\n> \nOK.  Thats interesting I need to look into that more.  I think I missunderstood. How are they distributed and to who? , how is it decided who gets how many?  \n> I didn't say there was. I don't think currency in any form is anarchist. I'm simply describing what I see as a useful transitional currency in order to arrive at anarchism.\n> \nBut we still have to actually get hold of resources to use this currency and thats what really matters, because if we have those resources we dont need the currency!\n> I see socialism as the way to get to anarchism. By making existing systems more easily accessible without using pure cash, you decrease the reliance on currency, and thus make it easier to eliminate. I'm curious how you intend to arrive at a stable anarchism with a smooth transition, if you simply reject socialism and general attempts at removing reliance on capitalism. Violent riots/revolutions don't tend to work. Look at countries that tried that. They almost always end up with a similar style of government, and not actually anarchism.\nSocialism hinders anarchy, if it didnt exist the capitalists would have needed to  invent it.  In fact thats why colonial countries like the UK adopted lots of marxist ideas (welfare, free schooling and eventually NHS) , anarchism was popular at around the same time, they were terrified of it.  Soft Marxism was used to appease an impending revolt and it held back anarchism (which in the 19th century gained huge popularity from the working class ) .  Soft socialism continues to hold  back that popularity to this day.   Emma Goldman would be turning in her grave at those who think socialism can lead to anarchy.",

Violent riots and revolutions don't work is simply not true.  Every revolution has worked becasue it got radical.  Civil rights, guerilla warfare, etc - not saying they gave us better ones - but look at Castro, his success was from radical fighting.

Smashing a window doesn't actually help anyone to begin living in an anarchy.\n> \n> Again, you're confusing short-term gains with long-term movements. Stealing something does literally nothing. Things are stolen every day. It does nothing to change the political/economic climate to an anarchy. No amount of looting or violent resisting of police will end up, say, making every building freely accessible. That will only come from society itself changing.\nNo, 'stealing' is a capitalist concept for a start. It doesnt really exist. But I assume you get this bit.  But you are wronmg it does nothing.  Catalonians 'stole' catalonia and the violently resisted the military.   Its the most successful example of an anarchist society in the last century.  Sure it didnt last.  Why?  Because the capitalists used violence and 'property claims / theft'  to take it all back.  And won.\n> \n> Right. Some sources will always paint anarchism in a bad light.

One way is to just buy it out, participating in capitalism. I lived in a city like that, owned by a single company. Another way is to simply convert everyone in that particular city over to anarchism. Remember, the point is to get people agree with and participate in anarchism. Not attack people and try to attack existing countries. The big problem is that many supply chains are based around the world and are heavily entrenched in capitalism. A violent reaction where we cut ourselves off and claim a small block or neighborhood or something is functionally useless. Kicking people out doesn't help. We need them to simply readjust their work for anarchism instead of capitalism.\n> \n> Believe it or not, making space habitable will do a lot to help push anarchist and decentralist values. The point of, say, colonizing mars is for the systems that are built. Food, water, shelter, etc. all easily available in a place that doesn't really have that stuff. On top of that, pushing for other-world colonization can be one way of kickstarting anarchism. Just simply not on earth. The moon, mars, etc. are all international and not all that regulated. Meaning it's the perfect testbed for anarchism. It's not as important, but I still see it as a good goal to have in terms of political views. As it stands, I'd much rather have the $600billion/year military budget spent on space/nasa, than on killing people.\n> \n> I cannot think of a single way to fairly distribute a currency and ownership without there being bias and a tendency to hoard and cause a growth economy.

See here for the theory behind it. Everyone who's a 'member' of the software (actually using it and confirmed to be a unique human by the community) gets a portion of the newly generated currency.

There's many benefits to anarchism that can't be truly realized until it's societal, rather than personal.\n\nHonestly     It has nothing to do with being 'edgy'  That is the media portrayal  of what this activism is about (there may be non anarchists who do that I dont know - just as there are capitalists that claim to be feminists too - it wouldn’t surprise me) but dont conflate legitimate and well thought out anarchist strategies for kids trying to look edgy.   Don't underestimate the real political purpose of damaging (private) property.  One effect is making customers wonder why their banks window is smashed and if the bank is as powerful as it thought, having not prevented it.  This can make people wonder if they can challenge their debt letters etc, it can have small psycological impacts on society that opnes up the dead zones of thier imagination and think about exactly what you wnated - a society of anarchists who defied the demands of financial institutions.  It shows, litterally, and unambiguously that it is possible.  The smashed window is a defiant act against that bank AND the state.",

But still, the law still exists and is enforced by an increasingly militarized police. And personally, I value the freedom I currently have. Given how much of a minority anarchists are at the moment, trying to 'steal' the US seems a bit far-fetched. I'll definitely have to look into Catalonia though. Sounds interesting.\n\nThats understandable.  But how else can anarchy come about?  Do you really think the rich will give up their wealth by talking them round?  You will have to prize it from their hands my friend. If you have a way we can do that otherwise I'm all for it.  I just don't see it.",

But I think taking physical action against the banks and defying  police approved march routes is not a temper  tantrum.  That is actually doing what you choose, its a defiant act and it makes the work of banks and corporations and police difficult and tiresome.   If mcdonalds is out of action for a week beacsue anarchists released  cockroaches in their restaurant it effects their bottom line.  It may be small.  But it does impact them.  The difference between protest and direct action is huge.>\n\nSo the trick isnt to stop doing what these anarchist are doing.  The trick is to scale it up.  Imagine every mc donalds having cockroaches added to it.   Imagine a global movement  where the act of smashing every bank window took place?  Wouldnt you say that would have a significant effect over a march.  The tactiocs arent wrong, whats missing is mass solidarity and global expansion of those kinds of actions on mass.. I'm not advocating people risk doing this. There is a lot to loose. But I think its theoretically something politically minded people should consider, rather than dismiss as thuggish and ineffective.

Technically speaking, most major businesses have enough saved to go decades without earning a profit. And killing off one business will do nothing in terms of the national and global economy or legal systems. And in reality, you're likely hurting the people who work at those locations more than the people enforcing the systems.\n> \n\nWhich is best:  Mass boycotting McDonalds.  Or mass campoaign to increase the wages of McDonalds workers (and buying moire burgers to support that)?   \n\nThe hurting people in capitalist workplaces line is a really not going to wash with many anarchists.  Its been used by socialists and capitalists alike to justify everything from pimping women as prostitutes to implimenting UK laws making it illegal for supermarkets to boycott Israeli products.  People will always be hurt when attcking capitalism.  Lots of people have pensions invested in oil and arms companies, we are all micro capitalists and have vested interests in keeping the capitalists in power.  Unfortunatly thats no excuse to ignore it and oppress the rest of the world who doesn’t have anything invested in it but misery.  All the people who dont even have minimum wage jobs at mcdonalds who live in the rainforsets being chopped down to supply burgers for example.\n\n\n> Sure. I'm certain they'll be the last to accept anarchism. The problem is that simply smashing windows or releasing cockroaches does nothing to them. They don't feel it. How they feel things is on large-scale systems. The political/legal system, large amounts of people opting out of the economy, a lifestyle change to opt out of using services/goods completely (not just boycotting for a week), etc. Big changes need big actions, and smashing a window isn't going to lead up to anything greater.

The question first has to be why would they take it?   Without private property and the ability to sell it what would be the point?

Wealth inequality only exists because the majority of people say it does. If the majority of people reject that, then it's not a thing. Imagine, instead of forcefully taking something, or breaking something, a wealthy person attempts to continue using their wealth. They can't drive their car because no one delivers the gas to fuel it. They can't fly where they need to go because no one flies them there. Perhaps these things are still done, but wealth is ignored entirely.  Opt out and reject the systems at play. Even if the wealthy attempt to claim something, there'd be no one guaranteeing that ownership for them. Simply put, when everyone refuses to 'play', power suddenly disappears. The issue, then, is getting everyone on the same page and opting out.\n\nBut the rich own all the resources to sell to the rich.  The poor just provide the labour.  You still need the rich to refuse to sell to the rich.  Refusing to play is fine as long as you can convince BMW not to sell luxury cars to rich people.   The only way to do that is to withdraw labour, or steal the cars.\n> \n> Oh I certainly don't have judgement about it. People are free to do it. I'm just saying it's an ineffective manner for bringing large scale anarchism.\n> \n> Neither. Mass boycotting of buying food indefinitely would be the proper answer. Boycotting McDonalds won't do anything. I already 'boycott' McDonalds. I just don't eat there. Hasn't done a damn thing. I encourage people to not eat there whenever possible. Not because I think it'll help anarchism, but simply because it's a shitty business. You need people to opt-out. If you're just moving your business from McDonalds to Burger King you haven't helped anything.\nNeither?  So what  do you actually DO about it then?  Sit back and hope the CEO of burger king grows a concience, that its workers will have an anarchist epiphany.  How do you even get others to think about anarchy without attacking the institutions that oppose it?\n\nHeres an apt piece published by anachist collective the other day. On the subject of action vs free speech : https://crimethinc.com/2017/01/26/this-is-not-a-dialogue-not-just-free-speech-but-freedom-itself\n> \n> I think you've mistaken what I'm saying. Attacking a particular location isn't going to help and will just cause inconvenience to bystanders who may be more than happy to join the cause right up until you interfered with their daily lives by releasing cockroaches where they try to make a living so they don't starve. Instead you'd want to do something like attack the stock exchange if you want to hurt the business itself.\nAna narchists job isnt to tell people what top think and do.  We can't please everyone or we will do nothing.  If you are upset becasue you want to eat at mcdonalds and don't like cockroaches thats not somethink anarchy can address.  Thats actually the problem.  People BUYING mcdonalds in the first place.  So who would buy a mcdonalds with cockroaches.  Answer: NOBODY!  Thats why its a good action it ignore peoples petty anoyances for what is right (to actuall stop mcdonalds destroying the planet, rather than just tell them they shouldnt - whuch people buying  burgers there wont like either ) .\n> \n> I don't see how that'd end up putting mcdonalds out of business. If anything they'd just push resources into security and laws to crackdown on it, and then get militarized police to stop it. \nThat would cost them and their shareholders may find its cheaper if they become more ethical.  It has ana efffect thats the poiint.  We can't be sure what will happen.  But no battle has a knowable outcome.  But let me ask - how do you propose to stop these corporations as an anarchist?\n>They aren't going to go out of business that way. Look at the big banks. They were pretty much doomed to close down due to financial impact. You know what they did? Lobbied the government and got a ton of money to keep going, and the people who were simply involved at the more basic levels were the ones who got hurt. The bankers themselves didn't even feel it.\nThey would if we all refused to pay our debts and mortgages.  The best way to do that is to demonstrate how angry they have made people and to ensure the public can see they have weaknesses - a bank with smashed windows isnt something they want people to see, it looks bad on them.   Like it or not people like symbols.  Like language and art, we need them to help us think about the world.  Riots are another example they arent there to get sympathy from the public, so much as to make the public question their position: 'Why are so many  people smashing windows, its not normal?'\n> \n> The problem is 'one mass global general strike' doesn't have systems in place to be able to make it indefinite. All the opposition would have to do is wait until people get hungry or have medical needs at which point most people will start working again.  \n\nDisagree.  mass strikes would effect shareholders profits and they too would loose money that they would notice.   Often shareholders aren't particularly rich - just middle class people trying to save for retirement.   But beyond that Strikes (even small ones) have proven time and again to help workers prevent pay cuts and maintain other rights   Its why the capitalists are so anti-union.  Strikes work.  They work well .  Of course under capitalism they only work within the framework of 'rights'  granted by our leaders.   A full strike could demand complete redistribution of wealth, but this would not be my goal.  I'd like it to lead to a block on the rich having access to resources  -with nobody to make them or sell them their money would be worthless.  Workers could control all the means of production.  And that would be the first requirement of anarchist society..\n\n>Even if you, say, had all of those people willing to steal (most aren't, morally, and likely wouldn't due to the existing law and their mindset of following it) then you'd still run out of food after it was all consumed. At which point the same systems would start back up and nothing would change. Instead you need to be able to just opt-out. Not just an angry strike where you're gonna go back to work after a week.\n\nNot at all, anarchists can still work to produce what they need.\n> \n> This is where I really draw an issue with people who seem to have taken more political classes than actually thought through what would really happen and what would be best. Realistically speaking, I as an individual don't really give a shit about 'the means of production'. I don't care if I have access to a factory. I care if I have access to, say, a shelter with functional electricity/heating/internet, food that I can eat, water to drink, some sort of transportation to get around, etc. These are also the things that people are the most likely to 'steal'. People don't steal factories or restaurants. They steal food and electronics. The 'possessions' as you call them. In ancap or any other system with a monetary system, these are the things that would be restricted and people would lack the ability to access. Which means the exact same problems exist: lack of communication, lack of food/water, lack of clothing/shelter, etc.\n\nBut all of these come from the means of production.  People do care if anyone can produce electricity and water/food.\n\n> Or if you're thinking of things like tools, look at it this way.  You don't need to own a bike. You need access to one to be able to quickly get around. And you're not always using it, so after you're done someone else can use it. A teddy bear, quite frankly, is unneeded. Besides a few handcrafted personal sentimental items (maybe) I don't really see much need for them. Wasting resources on it is inefficient, and I'm willing to guess no one will willingly work to mass produce them when there's no real value there. The 'value' was that people have a consumeristic mindset and have been indoctrinated to hoard things. And thus they buy unneeded things like teddy bears or other pointless material things. When you get rid of the profit angle, there's no need to produce or own those things.\nYou've taken my teddy bear example as important.  It isnt .  Just an example.  Nobody should be making them except as a hobby once everyone’s basic needs are satisfied..  Thats kinda my point.  You can possess a teddy bear, because nobody needs it.   If it becomes something that exploits resources and people it is no longer a possession but property that others need too.\n\n> There's also no need to own a factory or anything like that. You just use it. As I said, how would bitcoin even work if no ownership was guaranteed? Things that are needed would be taken and used. Things that aren't would not be bought or sold.\n\nMeans of production includes land, energy supplies, sewage works etc  .  Not just factories that produce crap we dont need.",

Specialization is what lead to the enormous production capacity we have these days.\n\nWhy?  Because most people, the poor, middle class, even a lot of the rich, spend most of their day working for someone else.   Middle class woman goes to work,  she pays a poor woman to look after her kids whilst she is at work earning her boss money so he can buy nice things for his kids.   And then somehow the poor woman has to look after her own kids too!  Who benefits from this circular system - it makes more sense for everyone to look after  own kids and work for own family.  What is the point in this kind of productivity except for its own sake, which usually means doing bullshit jobs, to sustain people doing bullshit jobs looking after the fallout of the bullshit jobbers (eg, cleaners sweeping the shit from office floors, and fast food workers serving busy managers of bullshit jobbers).  A vicious circle.   Why dont we all clean our own toilets and cook our own food, look after our own kids and garden, and work LESS hours doing other peoples work.    Who the hell should want to flip burgers all day for other people? Or clean the bosses toilets.    It might be great if you are able to afford it, but not for the poor (ie the majority of all humans) .    But even the middle class who use these people have to do shit jobs , long hours, to get paid so they can afford to pay these people to do the things they'd be otherwise doing themselves!   Save for a holiday so you can take time of work which you do so you can afford a holiday.  Rinse repeat.  Capitalism is stupid.   Its dangerous.  Its mind numbing.  Its soul destroying.  It ruins the planet.  And wastes our time.  Did I mention it is stupid?  Its insane to keep going on like this  (unless your at the top of the pyramid).  It cannot be reformed.  And doing one job all day every day (as most of us do) is mentally unhealthy, we need to be generalist workers, working few hours on many things.  We will surely die of boredom doing the same job all our lives.  Even if thats a 'good' job, repetition always becomes boring.   No wonder people are so damn depressed.  Efficiency is a drag.  Work should be abolished.  'In praise of idleness' by Bertrand Russell is one of my favourite anti-capitalist essays.  (consider how long ago it was written)  Theres some other great essays on the subject here as well if you are interested :  \n\nhttp://www.audioanarchy.org/antiwork.html",

What's essential is that it has to be truly voluntary, and not coercive by using artificial incentives like currency.\nYes, this is true ,  some people are passionate about doing one thing (though occasionally this can sometimes still be at the expense of others).  And this is fine if its a truly free choice.  But so few people get to do a job they care more about than anything else they could be doing with their time.\n> Imagine a world where people do what they love to do for others, and do what they need to do for themselves, and fill in any \"gaps\" with automation.\n\nI can imagine it.

As if hard work for the sake of it is good in itself (regardless of how useless that work is).  Its only good if it actually helps people, society and the individual grow and fulfil their true human potential and needs.. beyond making money.  Hard work, no matter how laborious and difficult, isnt automatically a good thing.  If its pointless work serving only the rich it is stupid and regressive and should not be applauded.  Our culture here seems to think all hard work should be revered and rewarded.  But hard work that does nothing for society and only helps meet capitalists wretched desires is repulsive and idiotic.

It works for small sites because the incremental cost is low, but it can't work to store everything forever (even when the content is interesting just to 1 person). The checksum-to-outside-world feature could be added, but why would anyone spend their time to checksum the entire ZeroNet? I think the current approach is fine and people who want to curate could develop integration with external blockchains for such use cases.\n\nI was thinking its way more simple than that.   As I understand it when you edit a post on zeronet your blockchain entry gets updated, this verifies the orignal creator (the only one with the key) updated something and that is now seeded to replace all old copies of that page adress.  If we can update that entry with a hash returned from a verifiable burn address then zeronet can automatically tell you the owners key has been burned (within the page), though of course the page itself will continue to be updated by the public forum assigned to that page.  At least I think this is possible, theoretically at least.  I may be wrong\n\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn",

It is possible to be a libertarian anarchist, in fact.\n> That would usually be anarcho capitalism, or anarcho syndicalism,, depending on your personal perception of freedom and liberty. The very basis of libertarianism however is limited state role in all aspects of an individual's life, which means minimal taxes and limited state role in social services. Social services from a libertarian standpoint should be maintained by the individual or private groups (commercial or not), because they are less likely to infringe on personal liberty than the state. Private groups don't impose taxes on the individual and don't impose a certain service on people (state education, for instance), which is why libertarians believe that private groups are naturally better than the state in this role.\n> I mentionned anarcho-syndicalism as a form of libertarianism, and I say that because it is naturally free association between people to attain the highest quality of life possible, without imposing it on anyone, which is what the state does.\n\nIt is possible to be a libertarian anarchist, in fact.\n\nNo it isn't.  Thats an oxymoron. (like anarcho-capitalism)  Anarchists reject all forms of authority.  Its the very foundation of anarchy.   .  When you say the state should stay out  'as much as possible' it doesnt answer when it should interfere? This is often the way with libertarians - they can tell us where the state doesnt interfere (same answers as anarchists) but rarely wish to mention where they think they should intefere - my concern is that a small/non-brurocratic state isnt the same as a weak one - you can abuse an entire nation with just one law and one department (eg the police/prison system).   I think theres a lot of good libertarians, whose ideas are well intended, kind and visionary, but when the state is there, any small role will still require extreme structural power (though violence - as with all current state systems)  to enforce it.   Also, if the state is small, how do we ensure any democracy is fairly overseen? ( I assume thats what you want the state to draw power from?)",

I will tell you where the State should interfere from a general libertarian standpoint: Defense and Immigration. The other domains will vary from people to people, but for almost every libertarians, defense should be held by the State as they view defense managed by private militias inefficient and the same for immigration.\n> As for democracy being fairly overseen from a modern liberal standpoint, and a reasonable one I think, would be confederalism and direct democracy. Swiss is a perfect example of a country that has achieved both, and that has a rather minimal State, yet not minimal. The States closer to the people should have more power than the central government, because they know better on which issues their citizens are concerned, and the federal government should work hand-in-hand with the States, as opposed to work against them. I think Swiss is truly a great example of such a country, but it is not a true confederation. It does have a lot of confederation-like features, and I think is a good example on how such an utopia could be achieved.\n> I should immediatly note that I am an anarcho-capitalist, not a minarchist, but I believe that reducing the State's size until it is essentially irrelevant, as corporation and private initiative takes over what ought to be bureaucrat's work happen. I think socialism is what is wrong with classical anarchism, and if socialism should be achieved in a state-less society, I feel like we'd be no more advanced than we are now, have replaced the state by begging barbarians. Of course, examples of very short-lived anarchic societies have happened in the past, but these were essentially composed tribes, and didn't live long enought to prove anything about classical anarchism. A lot of anarchic socialist belief is that participatory anarchism would work, but the problem with that narrative is that most of today's anarchists are simply Tumblr-kids having found out that it's hard to live in a capitalist society. Yes, it is, and this is why private initiative is so well compensated in a capitalist society, because hard work gives out great yield. In a participatory anarchistic society, we wouldn't have hard work, in fact hard intellectual work would probably not be compensated at all, unless you believe large scale anarcho-socialism is possible, but it is not. Intellectual work which would not immediatly benefit the society would likely be shunned, and the rations of the individual working on, for instance, programs, would likely be cut until they do something immediatly beneficial. People want to see immediate results, and it is in fact in the human nature, and this is why I do not believe in any other anarchistic societies than anarcho-capitalists societies.\n\nthe swiss economy depends on a attracting foreign investment by offering low corp tax rates and the same slave wage labour and forien  imports ( slave wages ) as the rest of the west.

Debt to capitalists is used to support only the capitalist to gain more power and violence over you.    Capitalists and govnts are interchangeable, they are the same thing, only nominally we are supposed to have a democratic say over state powers.  Not so for private states (corps).

Everyone wants to gain wins  peacefully over risking violence.  It just doesn’t work out that way.

People are idiots because they buy shit they can't afford and are forced into a job that doesn't value them. And then they look for more government to solve the problem, when in fact it's government that cause the problems in the first place.\n> If people weren't desperate, something they are because they live beyond their means, they wouldn't be forced to take underpaying jobs. In a free-market economy skilled, smart and unworried employees are valued because they performe miles better than someone who walks about worring about getting food on the table. That's what a job used to be like before governments came and fucked it up. In a free market the job owners usually (as a rule) genuinley care about their employees. But there are exceptions. And you are an idiot if you work for them. That's my point.\n\nThe problem is debt, I agree govnt doesnt solve their problems.  But I think their 'idiocy' is created by capitalist force (threat of violence)  as you say yourself.  They are *forced* into jobs.  It requires solidarity, help and community to help people out of their rock and hard place situation.    Anarchists promote organising, subverting the work place and helping each other out of it.  Idiots are those who think they can run away on their own and laugh at those left behind. Libertarians.",

Despite excessive corporate greed, and some regression in wage labour, over the last 200 years working conditions have improved for the vast majority of people in the west.

Threat of violence is fascist, and by definition something else than capitalists. They are not forced into jobs by employers. They are forced into jobs because they take stupid decisions. I believe that once the government stop treating people like babies and stop protecting corporations a new generations will raise to become street-smart and understands when they are about to be conned, tricked and decieved. Hence they will take better decisions, and become free.\n\nThe capitalsists are fascists.   They use violence (police and courts) if you don't pay what they assert is the debt.\n> \n> I believe the true root to this problem is that feminism forced mothers into the labour force to become \"free\". God knows how they managed to pull that magic trick off. \"Freedom is slavery\". Jesus the world is Orwellian. Anyway, I think you will agree that we have lost our humanity, friendships are becoming shallow and families are being split. When people once again are free, families and friends will take care of those in the need, but people need to be free to have the energy to take care of others. You cannot take care of others before you can take care of your self. Besides, a close relative of mine actually worked as a manager for a company that employed mentally and physically challanged people. Obviously their salary was low, but they were having a real job. This job ment the world to them. (Even though you would say they were exploited.) For the first time in their life they felt usefull and that they had a purpose. They didn't feel exploited and my relative didn't want to exploit them, he wanted to give them normal lives.\n\n  And I agree the patriarchy co-opted feminism to get 2 for the price of one in the workforce.   But I dont think women are the problem with family and friendships, anymore than men.  I  agree society lost its way. To capitalists who co-opted the state (because thats what all capitalists do).   So the mentally ill should have low salaries?  Why? Not treating people fair is exploitation.   Employing disabled is commendable only in a capitalist wordview.  Otherwise it should just be considered the norm.  \n> \n> You are talking about crony-capitalism. That is something that cannot exist without protection of the state violence. A free market (REAL capitalism) is not about stealing. Profit and stealing are two completely different things, and I don't know why you confuse them. Nothing has han absolute value. All values are relative. If you think that a house is worth $10 and the seller think it is worth $5, then the seller didn't steal $5 from you just because you paid $10. You VALUED the house to $10. Both parties are happy. If the buyer knew he would have sold the house for $5 he could be upset because he made a bad deal, but he still thought the house was worth $10, otherwise he wouldn't have paied $10 for the house.\n> \n\nAll profit is theft. As is property.   (Marx)\n\n> I will never understand this. Profit is what innovates. If you remove the incentive of making a profit, then why should anyone invest time and resources in improving something?\n\nNo, this software you are using is innoivative, like linux bittorent etc.   Profit doesnt innovate it hinders it, profit is what drove copyright and patent laws.  Capoitalists demanded them so they could increase their profits.  And innovation has stagnated for all we know wed have way more if it wasnt for such laws and profiit driven motives.  People are motivated to produce things without profit.",

You tell me:  IS capitalism about making profit or not?  If it is, how do you collect the profit , where is it derived from, and how do you make people pay debts without force (anarchism says don't make others do things by violence )  SO if your going to be ANARCHIST Captialist how will you make people pay for things you have profiteered from (and thus, by definition, don't need).  Nobody NEEDS profit, inless others exploit with profit. The argument is circular. Thats why 'crony' capitalism exists.  Capitalism is not reformable. Crony capitalism is the game of capitalisation.

(I genuinely think most capitalists would think you are wrong about it too)  The reason I use the internet is in hope to contribute to a better society for all.   As is the case with all the things I purchase and live with.  But its a straw man argument anyway.  My goal in life is perfect anarchy.  I can't create that single handedly. That doesnt mean I just wither and die instead of fighting and using the tools I have access too.   Even if they are products of capitalism.   I am a fish in a tank, I can't escape the toxic water and clean it from the outside.  And the reason I asked  why you use zeronet was because you specifically pointed out that capitalists make better innovators than open source ones.   That is not a straw man line.   Its a straight up question because unlike almost any other software, there are more capitalist social network  services than anything else.  Some belong to the largest corporations in the world.  And none of them are decentralised.  I think decentralisation of the web and blockchain tech is one of the most game changing innovations of the last decade.   And not one major software company came up with it, in fact they just didnt want it.   They spend more time fighting it than embracing it.  As they have with torrent software.  Thats the problem with profit.  It hinders innovation.   If microsoft had of invented bitcoin, it would never be allowed to exist. ",

(not for the current debate, but because i'm sick that not enough people know about this):\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THTR-300\n\nYes. Thorium reactor designs have been around since the 60s.  It has been suggested the US govnt and rich nation allies chose to ignore them in favour of the traditional nuclear reactor to give them material (and the excuse) to build nuclear weapons.  Investment and funding was blocked not because the plans weren't viable but because they were undesirable.    Little has changed.  Yes all nuclear is expensive.  But not as expensive as climate change.   Had wealthy nation govnts  invested in thorium - and given that working proptotypes already existed - we would probably have had many (safe) working reactors by now.    The key with thorium is they are *relatively* safe, they cant continue a meltdown if something goes wrong.  The half life of spent nuclear material is only around 100 years.  Not fool proof but infinitely safer than current uranium reactors. And crucially, thorium itself is abundant and found almost everywhere on earth.  Its not to say there are no problems with throium, just that is is by far and away the best solution we have to climate change, rather than following the fuitile path of 100% renewables using other current tech or continuing with fossil fuels.  We need to get building now.  Its our best chance.  And, warlock, this is a fine  example of how capitalism stifles innovation to protect profits of those with powerful interests (oil and gas).  Thorium is less profitable than oil/gas because oil and gas is in limited supply.  Like gold and bitcoin.  The desire for profit means oil will always be heavily invested in.   The goal of oil industry isnt to find or sell more oil, but to make sure no one else does.   The last barrel of oil will be as valuable as today's 10,000 barrels.  To profitteers thats all that matters.  Its usefulness is secondary to limiting supply.   And as far as I know, not a single nuclear reactor of any kind has been built by private businesses without HEAVY subsidies from the taxpayer.   Its not profitable.  And probably never will be.  But that shouldnt be our goal.  And is exactly why profit and capitalism can't ever solve the worlds problems.  The reason you arent using Microsoft or google decentralised web platform right now isnt because its not a great invention, its because its not profitable.  They can't control the market, access or supply of data.   Same goes for so much technology when left to capitalism. The motivations of profit conflict with the motivations of what people actually want.  Advertising is needed to train us to want what they are selling, and to give up on our imaginations and innate desires, to tell us they are fantasies and that only they have the solutions you can purchase for just 10 dollars eaches.  Warlock you should read DrSeuss's The Sneeches if you havnt already.  Its for children so should be accessible to you : the tale demonstrates a blindinlgy obvious problem with capitalism. Its not just about the state and power and control of resources (which is still a major issue) .  But about manipulating peoples desires.   And the idea you said:  that nice clothes and the latest smartphone are good things and the reason we need capitalism is because you  are a foolish star belly sneech.   But dont worry you are in for a good ending.   Don't forget the frankfurters.",

Of course the price of oil is profitable when there is limited supply compared to demand.  Like gold.  (hence the term black gold)\n\n>Later you reinforced the nonsensiacal claim by adding that everybody wants electricity, but lets assume you didn't say that.\nYou dont think everyone wants electricity?  ( By everyone I mean 99.999% of the worlds population - you seem to be  inferring some imaginary marginal group prefers not to have electricity and thus my argument is invalid because I said everyone  - that is obtuse and pedantic, and weakens your position further) \n\n> At the current oil price production is barley break even, and many oilfields even operate at a loss. This is true for oil in Europe, Russia and North America. Middle East is still special because they still have oil flowing naturally out of the ground. They have different problems though, where kings and princes claim the profits and some countries are \"bribing\" the public to compliance. This is extremly expensive.\n> So,Point 1) You claim they only push oil because there is more profit than in Thorium. Earlier you have also claimed that profit is the only motive. If this was the case, then a significant fraction of the production in North America and Europe should be shut down for the time being because they operate at a loss.\nWhat nonesense. Capitalism doesnt work that way and you know it. Youtube doesnt make any profit.  Nor does twitter (and never has) and (according to starbucks) nor does starbucks (in the UK, so it claims).  They are banking on future value.  Companies arent not closing oil fields for the good of humanity!  They are hedging their bets it will go up again.  \n> Point 2) Oil (excluding the Middle East) is extremly complex to produce because either you have to operate wells at deep water with platforms above several hundred meters of water and then drill wells several kilometers through rocks and mountains. For North America you have to fracture rock formation to get the oil, or you have to separate tar from sand, and then produce oil from the tar which can then be refined to petroleum. The energy return of investment is at an all time low.\nYes.  But its still the cheapest form of energy (cheapest as in it has the most profit margins after production costs).  And that is in limited supply.  Being at an all time low is nbot the same as worthless.  If only it was.\n> Compare this with Thorium, and the energy is readily available. The cost of producing Thorium could easily be approximatley free because of its abundance. \nNo.  Its expensive to build power stations for safety reasons.  It takes about 10 years to build one, minimum.\n>In other words, you could basically get \"free energy\" with Thorium, given that all your claims are true. In other words, those \"nasty\" capitalists could take something that was free (Thorium), bombard it with neutrons to create energy through a nuclear chain reaction. This energy is sold for a profit. To me this is clearly a much more profitable strategy.\n\nHuh?  No I said thorium is expensive and no company ever has  built a  nuclear power startions for commercial purposes without heavy state subs.   All I'm saying is that we should build them without motive for profit.  I'm happy to let the state  build them at a financial loss, as long as they provide energy and prevent global warming I couldnt care less about the profits/losses.  The social benefits are priceless.\n\n> So basically, if Thorium is as good as you claim, then the energy return of investment should be much higher for Thorium because of its abundance. If all your claims are true, then this is much more profitable (sell energy where the energy carrier is almost free). It is this argument I'm saying doesn't make any sense. Other than that I say that price is determined by both supply AND demand, which is regarded as a universal axiom in economics. And once again you are twisting my words.\nI said thorium could meet demand.  I also said It will never be profitable even if the supply is infinite.  It has no similarities with oil excep that it meets demand for electricity.  But as I keep saying, capitalism doesnt care about demand only profit.  Oil is cheap to extract than thorium (at least for now) .   So no company is interested without massive govnt subsidies to prop up their profits and even then increasing costs have on several occasions made them pull out and run of with they profits (see EDF)\n> With all that said, oil is a special comodity because the supply is not determined by market forces but by an oil cartel called OPEC. You claim that OPEC is also in control of the nuclear energy market in a global conspiracy. I do not believe so.\nI never said there was  a conspiracy.  They don't need one.  The laws of capitalism decide oil will be used because its more profitable than all other sources of energy.  And being limited in supply and high in demand it continues to make it so.  (there are no commercial aeroplanes that can run without oil - they dont exist, and as far as I know nobody is attempting to design one)",

The reason is simple. The first entrepreneur who can make Thorium energy work will corner the energy market. In other words, those who makes Thorium work can make the oil and gas more or less go out of business. Hence, there is a tremendous interest in the free-market to get Thorium to work! Once the technology is there to make it profitable, Thorium will come.\n> The profit margin per kWh for petrochemical might be higher, but the quantity of kWh for Thorium will, in the long term, far outweigh the high profit margin of petrochemicals. Especially now with the electric vehicle \"revolution\". \n> I guess this is what I have misunderstood where I though you were saying that capitalists didn't want to invest in Thorium because they wanted the limited supply of petrochemicals to increase profits.\n> Alternatively, Thorium might never be profitable. Then we will not have Thorium in a free-market. In this scenario I don't think the world would be a better place if we stopped using petrochemicals in favour of Thorium, even for environmental purposes. That's my opinion, and I'm sure you will disagree. ;)\n\nThorium does work.  It is just expensive.   The only obstacles to having thorium is free market capitalism - because thorium is not profitable (when oil is cheaper to use).  The 'free market' is why we don't have thorium, not because it doesn’t work.  The free market chooses to sell oil, its cheaper to mine and so profitable.  Until such time as the  natural SUPPLY of oil so rare that the price  makes Thorium cheaper.  By that time climate change and polution from all that spent oil will probably have destroyed us, but even if it doesnt, the free market still wont help, both will be unaffordable to the majority at that point.    Thorium isnt going to be profitable until oil supply has deminished, and then only the rich will be able to afford it  - unless we have a non-profit state subsidised energy industry - which would mean it was no longer a free market again.  Slice and dice it how you like, the free market will NEVER choose Thorium when oil is still cheaper.   The point at which thorium becomes cheaper is the point at which its all to late, and only the rich will be able to pay for thorium energy.  Money and capitalism and free markets are the obstacle to innovation.    We can build these reactors and save the planet, but economics and the endless pursuit of profit tells us we mustn't.  Profit over people.  Thats the real definition of the free market. \n\n",

I wore jeans and hoodies with holes in them. We had around 16-20 deg C in our living room depending on season. I showered rarley and with cold water. etc. etc. etc. I almost evangelized that the consumer-mentality people had would destroy the planet. Yet not a single person I met cared. They thought what I did was noble, but that it wasn't for them. Not ONE thought that maybe they too should take action. After 10 years I came to the conclusion that people just don't care.

If you believe so, you haven't understood An-Cap one bit.)\n\nBut most people on the planet already live with less than even what you did there.  The people who need to lead by example are the rich.  There are very few of them.  8 individuals own more than 3.5bn people.  (50% of the rest of the world population)  People not heating their houses or wearing clothes with holes in them, I agree is noble, but I dont give a damn about either.    Capiotalism has created astronomical levels of inequality, assuming you arent super rich, you are not the problem or concern of anti capitalists.  But if ever you do get super rich then you will be.

It should not exist, is a cancer on the world, and deserves to be abolished. I wouldn't want businesses here. Half the point for me is to get away from centralized monopolies that hoard and abuse data.
