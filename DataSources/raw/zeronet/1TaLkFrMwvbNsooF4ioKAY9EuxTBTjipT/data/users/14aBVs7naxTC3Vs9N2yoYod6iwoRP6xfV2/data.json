      "body": "I think we should start to focus on more walls - not just at the Mexican border, but globally.  Captured ISIS and other freedom fighters can be put into forced labour to reduce construction costs.  We'll let everyone inside the wall fight each other and work it out themselves; ideally only few survivors would remain at the end.  Anyone caught trying to penetrate the wall, either by foot, tunnel, or air, will be shot on the spot and symbolically hung from the wall like they do with dingos on the Australian dog fence.\n\nMake walls great again!",
