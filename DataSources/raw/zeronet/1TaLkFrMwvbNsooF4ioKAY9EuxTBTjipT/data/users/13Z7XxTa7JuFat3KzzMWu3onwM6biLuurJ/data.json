			"title": "Recent ZeroMe structure is bad for hub migrating and censorship proof. My idea is...",
			"body": "Although I'v posted my idea under @kaffie 's post in ZeroMe, I'd post here for better discuss.\nAs you can see, both @kaffie and @bot migrated their hubs, but I don't think they were perfect migratings. [As @kaffie said](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit/?Post:25#Comments), his old posts have to be left in the old hub because the comments (posted by others) linking to the old posts are still there, he can NOT migrate them. That's the problem! Just imagine, the old hub owner censors your old posts but your migrating does not help. In that case, you lose data, old posts or old posts' comments. So, recent ZeroMe is not designed for graceful hub migrating.\nIMO, comments (posted by others) and likes should be in the sub folder of the user folder, which allows the user to control all of the comments and likes, migrate them as a whole. That is **Nested includes** if i'm not wrong (see [official doc](http://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/content_json/#includes)).\nWith Nested includes, there will be an issue of  increasing your folder size, but it can be resolved via counting the sub-sub-folders' size by commenters' ZeroID addresses, consuming their own quota, not yours. This counting method may eat more CPU, RAM and I/O, but we could use database or something to make it eat as little as possible.\nIn case of something unexpected happen, e.g. censorship by hub owner/post owner,  or hub private key being stolen, or even their misoperation, we need the feature of backup hub, I described the idea in [this post comments](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeroblog.bit/?Post:65#Comments). In addition, all my comments posted to sub folder of an user in other hubs should be also backup-ed to my profile's primary hub and backup hubs in case of something unexpected happen.\nI afraid it would not be easy to implement these 2 features, especially Nested includes style comments, with migrating all the  recent ZeroMe users' data during update ( just like we had the old ZeroTalk's data locked about one year ago and started a blank new one--the one we are using now to support ZeroID ). But at the early stage of ZeroMe, this is more or less acceptable, as ZeroTalk switch from the old one. The sooner the better.",

			"body": "## Update: this tutorial may be out of date. The newest APK is developed here: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy and compiled/packaged automatically by Travis CI: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy/releases\n\n- Using [this doc](http://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)  to install buildozer and other dependencies. Ubuntu16 is recommended, you can install Ubuntu16 in a virtual machine. ( You can use [kivy  official virtual machine image](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android-vm.html#kivy-android-vm), but not tested.)\n- Download [ZeroNet source code](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) and [ZeroNet-kivy souce code](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy), copy all things of ZeroNet source code to `zero` sub-folder of `ZeroNet-kivy`, and then do as [this doc](http://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) says, enter the said `ZeroNet-kivy` folder in terminal, run `buildozer init` to create buildozer.spec file in  ZeroNet-kivy folder ( you can use the existing buildozer.spec file provided by ZeroNet-kivy project )\n-  Use your editor to edit buildozer.spec. The modification can be `source.include_exts =`、`requirements = sqlite3,openssl,m2crypto,gevent,msgpack-python,pil,hostpython2,kivy` ( if your want to use old toolchain, it might be `requirements = sqlite3,openssl,m2crypto,gevent,msgpack,pil,hostpython,kivy`, new toolchain is highly recommended)、`orientation = portrait`、`android.permissions = INTERNET`、`log_level = 2`. The above  modification is not perfect, you can try your own.\n- ( Optional ) Proxy setting. During auto-compile, it will auto-download and install many dependencies, as well as download xml files from google. After run next step's command and SDK is downloaded, if you want to set proxy you can run `$HOME/.buildozer/android/platform/android-sdk-20/tools/android` file after it is set executable, do some settings including HTTP proxy via menu Tools->Options ( if you can't find menu , please google `android sdk proxy setting`, you'll find how to do that via config file). You can also use VPN anyway.\n- In the terminal window of second step,  run `buildozer -v android_new debug logcat >buildozer.log` to start auto-compile ( if you want to use old toolchain, run `buildozer -v android debug logcat >buildozer.log` instead). If it says some dependencies are missing or too old, you should install them manually; if it says error and fails, search the error in google. If you use new toolchain, the most tricky thing is that after it says success, you need to remove all lines related sqlite3 (usually at the bottom of the file) from  `ZeroNet/.buildozer/android/platform/build/dist/your_app_name/blacklist.txt` and `ZeroNet/.buildozer/android/platform/build/dist/your_app_name/build/blacklist.txt` manually, save the file,  and then run `buildozer -v android_new debug logcat >buildozer.log` once more! ( who can help to file  buildozer project an issue of this? I've google it was said that sqlite3 is supposed to be auto-removed from blacklist.txt if you specify sqlite3 in the buildozer.spec)\n- If compiling succeeds, a bin folder appears in ZeroNet folder, where your APK is lying in it. You can copy it to your phone to install\n- You can use adb or other log viewer to see python output log by searching for(or filtering) keyword `python` and see ZeroNet ifself output log by searching for(or filtering) keyword `zn`. Some part of logs can be found in External Storage/Android/data/package_name(e.g. android.test.myapp17)/files/zero/log\n\n**How to use**：\n- Be careful of your phone's firewall and permission control, let the APK go.\n- If you have any problem using the web UI, you can try anther browser\n- If you wanna shut down, click ZeroHello's top-left ⋮ button, choose `shut down`\n- You can update ZeroNet itself source code just as you do in PC: click ZeroHello's top-left ⋮ button, choose Version x.x.x( rev xxxx), regardless saying Up to date. Just choose it, you'll get newest dev version of ZeroNet.\n\n（my packed APK and other things you might be interested can be found [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:10_13Z7XxTa7JuFat3KzzMWu3onwM6biLuurJ)）",

The newest APK is developed here: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy and compiled/packaged automatically by Travis CI: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet-kivy/releases\n\nYesterday I released a newer test version of it in small group of ZeroMe Chinese community for testing, soon problems were found. The biggest problem is that it crashes when new version APK tries to write data to external storage instead of internal storage where old version writes. The problem only affects on Android 5.x, which has a known bug of wrong write permission management. The ZeroNet's log says `Operation not permitted` when writes users.json/sites.json etc., and then it ends running. But the tricky thing is it actually writes successfully! IMO in py code this `Operation not permitted` exception can be well dealt with or just ignored to avoid the issue. It can first try to write, and then read, if it confirms writing is OK, then is OK to go next.  _** @nofish , This problem is most urgent currently, as being a new version release blocker.**_\n\n---\n\nSecond problem is actually found in the first test version' feedback. Many users have not root their phone, so it's hard to import their users.json to the internal storage where old version's data stored in. So I tried stored data in external storage this time. Another reason to stored data in external storage is internal storage is so small that we cannot store many sites' data in it. But storing external is facing another problem: other apps on the phone can access the sensitive data  ( e.g. users.json, sites.json, some db, some zites' data) . As a result, we really need more argument of ZeroNet, e.g. ` --pri_dir` to specify path of private and sensitive info directory.\n\n---\n\nThird problem is battery and data quota consuming in mobile devices. IMO we need more arguments to specify:\n- number of peers to help transmitting\n- time interval to sleep and wake up to get site's update\n\nWith these arguments, we can auto-adjust the behavior of ZeroNet in different scenarios, e.g. using Wifi or cellular data, being charged or low battery. Of course, users can adjust it by themselves.",

			"title": "Discussion on porting C/S centralized web framework/Apps to ZeroNet, not so hard as you think",
			"body": "At the moment we talk about only Python opensource web framework/Apps, e.g. django. Many Apps are based on django, including forum engines, CMS, wiki engines...In theory, if we manage to port django, we can port many Apps very easily. Of course, django is one of the Python web frameworks, just take it as an example when I am talking my idea.\n_We should find the most graceful and easy way to do the porting._\nSo my idea is:\n- every node runs ZeroNet and django locally at the same time (django as a super-plugin downloaded automatically by ZeroNet)\n- implement a reverse proxy written by Python. The reverse proxy works like a man-in-the-middle between browser and locally-running django. Every change ( e.g. administrator changes the settings, users post a comment) submitted from browser to django, which I'd call `commit`, is transited forward to django by the reverse proxy.\n- at the same time, the reverse proxy also submits a commit ( probably as a json file ) to ZeroNet to sign and publish ( probably via ZeroFrame). Private data will be encrypted before leaving the machine and decrypted before forward to browser by the reverse proxy ( just think about ZeroMail ).\n- of course, the build-in user authentication of django should be removed or disabled, and completely open for any commits since ZeroNet does user authentication via ZeroID ( already )\n- when get other users' json from P2P network, commit to django after checking signature. django will treat a commit as if a original user submit it.\n\n@nofish , Please consider this when you are giving TED talk. (A picture showing the structure may be needed.) IMO the porting would be a big step to make the internet more decentralized and significantly attract people's interest of ZeroNet.\nAny ideas from anyone are welcome. @bot @waterrabbit\n\n---\n\nQ&A:\n- Why we need to port them?\nBecause they are developed for many years, typically have many user-friendly features which ZeroNet lacks and may take long time to implement. I don't think we can easily build a ZeroNet-native discourse from scratch because there are tons of features and tweaks to do. ( I just use discourse as an example)\nAnother thing worthy considering: what if import _existing_ discourse forum to ZeroNet? Extremely difficult if no porting because of the huge difference of structure. The use case: Alice has no money to pay the hosting fee for her _existing_ discourse forum, Bob suffers DDOS to his _existing_ discourse forum, both of them want to import their own sites to ZeroNet.\n- Security?\nAll the python super-plugin including the django and the App on it, should be open-sourced, patched and updated officially. A GUI for user to enable or disable them. Impossible for zite owners to do evil things.\n- Mobile client?\nWe can try our best to port the web framework/Apps to Android/iOS, also we can offer semi-thin client and thin client of ZeroNet _with the reserve proxy._ Semi-thin client means ZeroNet runs on mobile phone and contact random public remote proxy server running the web framework/Apps through the local reserve proxy. Thin client is similar to semi-thin client except that only runs the reserve proxy without a locally running ZeroNet.\n\nFor your information:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_frameworks#Python\nhttps://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#cms\nhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/ContentManagementSystems\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems#Python\nhttps://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/tree/master/pythonforandroid/recipes\nhttps://djangopackages.org/\nhttps://github.com/rosarior/awesome-django\n\nPS: django is actually portable because its dependencies ( argon2-cffi and bcrypt ) are [optional and not used by default](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/docs/topics/auth/passwords.txt) and totally useless for ZeroNet's authentication.\nafter quick search, the web framework [Flask](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Flask&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) is also OK as it supported by python-for-android ",

From there, if I were to build a decentralized website, I would go ZeroHello. Freenet allows for that but isn't accessible from the clearnet. I like the Freenet's decentralized encrypted storage system, unless I missed something with ZeroHello, a website has to be \"followed\" by a peer to stay available, there is no way to provide storage to the ZeroHello peer so that random data can be saved. I need to spend more time reading the blog, but is it possible to have several administrators for a ZeroHello website, the same way we do for a centralized website I mean, two people not being at the same place and being able to edit the same website. By the way, do we say ZeroHello or ZeroNet when we talk about decentralized websites? Thanks to all.\n\ni don't know much about Maelstrom and Freenet, so i can't comment more.\nAFAIK, we say ZeroNet rather than ZeroHello, because ZeroHello is one of sites in ZeroNet. ",

Take this example:\n> Once upon a time a couple of torrent programmers decided that it is important to have a p2p chat system between torrent peers. They took pascal and wrote free peer to peer software called 'sky p2p' or better known at that time as 'skyper'. But they couldn't register doman skyper.com because someone already had it, so they shorthen domain to skype. For a while it was great, it worked and was fun, but had a problem that people would have same name and no way of reserving it - there was no central server for the authentication...\n> ... cut a long story short...over some long time... & lot of money exchanging hands...& passing ownership over code...\n> These days Microsoft makes 'Skype for business' to replace Lync as instant messenger in enterprise environment.\n> Where the idea started, where it ended up?\n\ngood example, thx!",

In other mode, we don't worry about anonymity.  And I2P can keep anonymity when torrenting, ZeroNet should supports I2P.\n\n>Using a browser extension (or a separate browser that also support Torrent protocol) sounds like a better idea.\n\nAsking users to install another thing is not a good idea.\n\n> You won't be able to play most of the videos in the browser, because of various video/audio codecs. If you want to create a youtube alternative, that can play videos in browser, then you need to re-encode videos before upload which is really hard to do in browser.\n\nNowadays more and more videos are already encoded browser-friendly.
