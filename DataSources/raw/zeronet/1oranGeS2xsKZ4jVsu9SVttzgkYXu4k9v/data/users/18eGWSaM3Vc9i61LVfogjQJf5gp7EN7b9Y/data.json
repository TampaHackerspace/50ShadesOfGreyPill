			"body": "Hello ZeroMe. As you may recall, around mid-January spammers took over ZeroMe for around twelve hours until @nofish so graciously provided a mute feature. What you may not know is that when you mute a user, the files you have already downloaded from them are still residing on your computer, and are thus being redistributed. Due to some *ahem* undesirable material being posted, I thought I would make a utility to remove such for you all. \n\nIt's a ```bash``` script (or on Windows, ```cmd```) script that automates the process of finding, shredding and removing all content by your list of muted users.\n\nI've posted it on my [ZeroBlog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Bo6oCbFEMhy1ejrehrSTGxiotgDsYCMJq/?Post:2:scrub,+a+tool+to+remove+muted+user%27s+content) for all to download, but including Windows dependencies means the zip is over the size limit for *paste zites.\n\nHere's the (dependency-less) ```bash``` version: http://127.0.0.1:43110/17iF64gTLycSohUSJsFyq7FMYsQfMqghJa/?18eGWSaM3Vc9i61LVfogjQJf5gp7EN7b9Y_4\n\nAnd Windows ```cmd```:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/17iF64gTLycSohUSJsFyq7FMYsQfMqghJa/?18eGWSaM3Vc9i61LVfogjQJf5gp7EN7b9Y_5\n\nI hope this proves handy :D\n\nEDIT: One should not post when sleep deprived.

			"body": "@Styromaniac: TL;DR: ```users.json``` appears to be the bottleneck, plus questions about retrieving a specific cert on unknown zite load. Would take modifications to cert usage API, aka @Nofish is in final command of that.\n\n To be specific; each zite that allows non-owner users to add or modify content to it (see ZeroMe, Talk, Mail, etc) has a file that controls how users may do so; in the examples provided, this is controlled by ```ZITEADDR/data/users/content.json``` file, which you can see under the ```includes``` object of the root content.json. This file contains a ```cert_signers``` object, which can contain zero or more ```.bit domain: [ \"signing_pubkey\" ]``` arrays, enabling certs which have been signed by the private keys which those pubkeys corrospond to to post according the rules under the ```permission_rules``` object, which appear to be regexes. Anyway, there's a difference in how your users.json hold them; each .bit domain is stored as its own object and has some extra data to make functional. Since each one is only stored by its .bit domain and JSON cannot store an object of the same name under the same parent, it cannot hold more than one cert per issuer; I wonder if it would be wise to append a number after the cert's .bit identifier, or if an object can be stored under an array and then safely accessed.\n\nIn addition, it's actually a two-step process to enable a set of signers; you also have to modify either your source CoffeeScript files or the js files they compile into to allow the UI to select your cert. Why that is, I have no idea. Seems silly.
