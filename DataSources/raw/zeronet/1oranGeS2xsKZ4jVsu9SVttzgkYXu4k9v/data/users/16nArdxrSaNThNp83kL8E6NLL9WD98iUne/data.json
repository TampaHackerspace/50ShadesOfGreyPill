If you screw up a translation you can cause misunderstandings. Including a translation feature implies that it's reliable enough to be used in everyday interactions. Plus the amount of space required to store the dictionaries and other components of a translation system would make it impractical to implement on Zeronet at the moment. Companies like Google have been working on translation for years with paid employees dedicated to it that have the latest in AI and neural network technology, and they still have issues. Especially when translating between languages like English and Chinese(the most used languages on Zerome at the moment).\n\nIf you or someone else wants to work on a Translation plugin for Zeronet, go right ahead, but I'm pretty sure Nofish is busy with Zeronet itself right now. Also as I said, there's no reason you can't use existing translation tools with Zeronet.",
