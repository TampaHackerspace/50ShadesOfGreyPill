The thing that pisses me off most is that my ISP (Spectrum) router is broadcasting a company hotspot that I can't turn off. They are ripping me off for the crappy service they provide (1 whole Mbit up for only $80/mo), on top of degrading my service to provide a wifi network which I can't even use cause I don't pay for it. I would kill for choice. ",
