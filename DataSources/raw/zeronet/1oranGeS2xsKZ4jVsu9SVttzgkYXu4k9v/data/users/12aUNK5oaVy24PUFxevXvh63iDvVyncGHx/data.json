ZeroNetPlus has a spam tagger, for example which you could probably use to train the spam detection algorithm, as long as people flag what is spam and what isn't. There might even be o/s spam detection libraries available... Another thing that is effectively spam is comments in languages you don't understand. It would be great if a little bit of javascript tagged a comment as one language or another so users could filter out what they don't understand. ",

I'm not sure if it is possible to \"not trust new accounts\" because the data is transferred to peers regardless of whether it is spam or not. It would be better if we could block spam before it is distributed, rather than after. Proof of work for new account creation might actually work, if it is, say ~30s long, and continuously improved over time...",
