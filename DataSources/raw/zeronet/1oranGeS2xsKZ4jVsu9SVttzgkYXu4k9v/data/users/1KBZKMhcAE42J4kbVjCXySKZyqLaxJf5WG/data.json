But I'm not sure they are actually \"free masons\" or really related to masonry at all. They like false flags, sometimes they try to make you believe they are jews, sometimes masons, etc. They do a lot of psychological profiling and mind control experimentation and already have keys for many psychological types. They can make most people believe what they want and do what they want in such way that person will think it's his own desires and interests or even that he is hero and helping others while actually he is part of yet another gangstalking/spy subnetwork.",

			"body": "@Flyman: The only one such technique for which I found any information is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind It can take a lot of forms and can be very subtle. Also there is a set of techniques for destroying your values. They vary, but an example is to convince that something you like is either of pure utility value or useless. Also they like to play on your negative energy. If they can turn you into hating jews/masons for example, then they'll try to direct your hate in a way useful for them, and it may end up completely unrelated to jews or masons at all. I think they have a lot of small groups of haters which can be used for killing their enemies. An example is a small community of girls who had extremely bad experience in relationships with <this-kind-of-guys-and-you-are-_obviously_-one-of-them>. And the same goes for humanists. There are some roleplayers which think they are helping you, but actually what they say and what they do pisses you off and is intented to turn you into rage or depression or even suicide. Most of tricks I don't quite understand, it's just obvious they are trying to mess with your mind. Also can mention they are also using subtext a lot, where information is present in such a way that if you show it to anyone who don't have all the context you have, they just don't see the message. If you try to explain the hint, you will look like crazy.",

I think I'm quite autistic too, and may have problems with that hormone as well, yet I'm more into free will. The only time I socialize well, have a lot of emotions and being open to people is when I take enough drugs like amphetamines, mephedrone and mdma. Though I'm more likely some sort of schizo, but autistic and schizo spectrums seem to be related and have many intersections.",
