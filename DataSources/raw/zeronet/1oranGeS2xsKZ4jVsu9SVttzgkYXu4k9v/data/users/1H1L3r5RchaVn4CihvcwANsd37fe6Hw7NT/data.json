			"body": "My ISP just said they'd be imposing a data cap on my service. I'm so angry. They say we don't use nearly that much data, and last month we barely used half, but I think they are leaving out key information.\n\nFor example, they only showed data usage for three months in the graphs they sent us in an email. September through November. The thing is though, usage was steadily going up by a lot between each of those months. It's likely we use more than in November now. My mother even said her streaming usage dropped off a lot after the summer was over. \n\nThat makes me think they are only showing us a small sliver of the big picture to make it look like we use a lot less than we really do. Broadband data caps are trash, and they only exist as a way to get more money without doing any more work.",

My father understands the issues I have with what is happening, but thinks that as long as we aren't close to the limit, there's no reason to do anything about it. He says if we had an alternative to switch to, we would, but there isn't. \n\nThe latest data they provided was from November, and I think the amount of data I'm using has gone up significantly. I got a VPN for torrents, so I've been using a lot of data on that lately, which I hadn't been before. I'm positive that I used a few hundred GB more in the past couple months than previously. This sure is great!",

I probably still will, but I'll need to test the waters when the data cap comes into effect, just in case I end up using more than expected. \n\nMost zites aren't very large, but what if I am seeding images on those zites or something?",
